		Hi there! This is <strong>Parth Parikh</strong> [ પાર્થ પરીખ ] [ <a href="me.jpg">my pic</a> ] [ <a href="blogs/blog.html">blog</a> ].
		<br><br>
		I am currently pursuing B.E in Computer Engineering from <strong>Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology, Mumbai</strong>. Having lived in Mumbai for more than a decade, I know quite a lot about this city.
		<br><br>
		What started with poems and short stories, made a halt at computers and I am 19 so there is a long road ahead. Topics such as <i>cryptographic functions, text analysis, discrete mathematics, statistics and artificial intelligence</i> interest me.
		<br><br>
		When in the mood for fun, I do the usual read-binge-listen. I am a huge movie buff, mainly interested in crime, thriller and sci-fi genre. Here is my latest pick: <i>Andhadhun</i> ( Bollywood ) and <i>2001-A Space Odyssey</i> ( Hollywood ). The sports I follow are Formula 1 ( motorsport ) and Cricket. Apart from these, Politics and Current Affairs interest me. I am a numismatist as well.
		<br><br>
		I love solving problems on Project Euler. My friend key: 1257816_QGLDawLV9eWOcv9e0Tq4lDmxsrdkVP0G.
		<br><br>
		In case you are wondering why this site is using plaintext, having used Jekyll and Wordpress in the past, I love this minimalistic and clutter free approach for a personal web-site.

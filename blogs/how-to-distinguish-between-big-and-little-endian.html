<h1>How to distinguish between big and little endian?</h1>
<p>For any person studying computer science, confusing terminologies are ever-present. It is probably because the field has yet to age gracefully. Nevertheless, today we have terminologies like Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas, car-cdr (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR<i>and</i>CDR">Wikipedia</a>) and little-big endianness. In this blog-post we are going to discuss the latter, i.e. endianness.</p>
<p>Endianness is a mannerism of ordering <b>bytes</b> in a multi-byte number, i.e do you want to order the bytes MSB first or LSB first.</p>

<p>Little-endian is when the first <b>byte</b> is placed in the LSB position, continuing towards MSB whereas Big endian is when the first <b>byte</b> is placed in MSB position continuing towards LSB.</p>
<p>Why does the order of bytes matter so much?<br>
It matters as different applications have different endianness. For processor architectures (ARM, x86) little-endian is used whereas for networking protocols (UDP, IP, TCP) big-endian is used. To check the byte-order of your PC, type <code>lscpu</code> (LINUX) in the terminal.</p>
<p>How to remember which is which?<br>
The way I remember is by recalling the abbreviation <b>LL</b>, which means Little-Endian -> LSB first. The reverse will be true for big-endian. Note: I understand that this is confusing as LL can be misunderstood for Little-endian -> Left.</p>

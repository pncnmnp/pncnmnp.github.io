        So, a few months back, I posted a blog about an old poster I found at my
        local bookstore, Reader's Corner.
        <a href="./addressograph.html">It was about an Addressograph</a>, and in
        the blog, we discussed what an Addressograph was, its origins, and we
        tried to estimate how old my poster might be.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's been a while, and guess what? I've been visiting Reader's Corner
        often, and I have discovered many more amazing gems! I'm considering
        turning this into a blog series.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually, I love sprinkling my technical blogs with stories as there is
        something remarkably beautiful about understanding how things were
        introduced, rather than jumping straight into what they are about. In
        this busy day and age, it feels comforting to trace our steps back and
        reflect on the humble beginnings of a field. Although this is not an
        overly technical blog post, I believe that the spirit of my writing
        remains the same.
      </p>

      <h2>The Poster</h2>
      <p>Today, we will be exploring the following poster:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/navitrainer.jpeg" width="80%" />
        <figcaption>My poster showing how a Navitrainer looks like.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This poster shows two men using what is known as a navitrainer. The
        description of the poster says the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Navitrainer” practice is the last step in ground training. This machine
        simulates actual flight. It can be set to “fly” over the map at ten
        inches per hour, corresponding to speed of 160 knots in a real airplane.
        The cadet above is peering through the drift meter at the map beneath,
        which moves sidewise to give illusion of drift. Navitrainer gives
        practice in dead reckoning.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Before we proceed, let's briefly explain the term
        <i>dead reckoning</i> mentioned in the description.
        <a
          href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/dead-reckoning
        "
          >According to the Cambridge Dictionary</a
        >, it is defined as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        a way of calculating the position of a ship or aircraft using only
        information about the direction and distance it has traveled from a
        known point
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In simpler terms, if a pilot knows their aircraft's airspeed and
        heading, and the time that has passed since the last known position,
        they can use dead reckoning to estimate their current position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, it is said that Christopher Columbus and many other early
        explorers heavily relied on dead reckoning and celestial navigation
        during their voyages. However, as you can imagine, this could lead to
        significant errors, especially on long voyages over the open ocean.
        Columbus famously underestimated the distance to Asia, leading to his
        accidental discovery of the Americas. If this tangential topic
        fascinates you, I encourage you to explore
        <a

        by C. V. Sölver & G. J. Marcus.
      </p>

      <h2>It's Origin</h2>
      <p>
        During one of my visits to Reader's Corner, I asked them how they
        curated these fascinating pictures. They enthusiastically told me how
        they would scour through old catalogs of Life magazines in search of
        these unique posters. Doing a reverse search on the description, sure
        enough, leads to one of
        <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=VU4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false"
          >Life Magazine's issues from September 28th, 1942</a
        >. Apparently, Life magazine was running a piece onaerial navigation
        <i>aerial navigation</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The article itself is fascinating, and I encourage you to explore it. It
        describes the science of navigation used by the U.S. Air Force's
        navigation officers. It starts by exploring
        <i>pilotage</i> (point-to-point flying by recognizing landmarks),
        followed by dead reckoning, and lastly, navigation using the stars. When
        discussing their instruments, the following was stated:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        …. the Air Forces teaches their use in four stages. In stage one
        (below), plywood models define the principles of each instrument. In
        stage two (above), cadets practice exhaustively on demonstration setups
        of the actual instruments. Third stage (opposite page), puts cadets
        through the routine of a flight with all instruments mounted in a
        “Navitrainer” which crawls slowly over a map. The fourth stage of
        instrument training is carried out in the air. Here, with compass, drift
        meter, computer, sextant and radio, cadets guide their trainers through
        fog and Texas thunderstorms. After 15,000 miles of practice flights all
        over the U.S, they acquire a fierce absorption in their dials and
        computers that make them able to plot an accurate homeward course in
        pitch-black darkness while their bomber is bouncing through the flask of
        an enemy target.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So it seems like the functionality of Navitrainer closely resembles that
        of flight navigation simulators we see today. From the instruments they
        described, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextant">sextant</a> is used to
        measure the angle between two visible objects. Moreover, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_meter">drift meter</a>
        is a tool used in aircraft to measure the drift angle, which is the
        difference between the direction an aircraft is pointing (its heading)
        and the direction it is actually moving (its course). It's kind of like
        trying to walk in a straight line towards a building, but there's a
        strong wind blowing from your right side, pushing you to the left. The
        difference in direction is known as the drift angle.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can imagine, strong winds can cause the aircraft to drift off its
        intended course. By using this device, pilots can measure this drift and
        adjust the aircraft's heading to compensate for the wind effect, thereby
        improving the accuracy of dead reckoning calculations.
      </p>

      <h2>Deconstructing a Navitrainer</h2>

      <p>
        Let's begin by asking ourselves what the US Army Air Forces aimed to
        achieve using this device. Well,
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=10VQAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA8">
          in one of the confidential documents released by them</a
        >, they mention the following:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Designed by Lieut. Col. C.J. Crane, new Navitrainer, time-cutter in
        training military flyers, simulates flight navigation on the ground and
        gives students nearly all the elements of actual flight, including day
        and night navigation over water or land, and even over overcasts where
        only radio bearings and celestial navigation can be used. Operational
        features of Navitrainer are detailed. <br />
        - Flying and Popular Aviation Feb '42 pp 70, 104, 106 2 illus
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This reinforces our belief that the device was intended to be used as a
        flight navigation simulator for students. In a 1943 article on
        <i>training devices</i> in
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=aGf74T8yUzMC&pg=PA42">
          The Official Service Journal of the US Army Air Forces</a
        >, the workings of a Navitrainer were explained in some detail:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The Type G-1 Navigation Dead Reckoning Trainer, more commonly known as
        the "Navitrainer", is a compact device supported on a triangular moving
        base. Problems in dead reckoning navigation may be simulated and the
        results recorded.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        The Navitrainer is composed of three main assemblies: the navigator's
        car triangular frame and the windtroducer. The navigator's car contains
        the plotting table, drift meter, compass and other flight instruments.
        The car is totally enclosed by a canopy and is mounted on the frame,
        which moves in any direction and travels at a speed proportionate to the
        air speed of the simulated airplane. The windtroducer serves two
        functions. It introduces wind direction and velocity, and it supports a
        chart or map that is used as a reference for determining the simulated
        airplane's position or course of travel.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        An instructor, who exercises supervision through an externally located
        instrument control box, can introduce drift and control the readings on
        the other instruments. This equipment operates from a standard AC light
        outlet.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        However, there are still a few questions remaining. For instance, where
        is the windtroducer located in our poster? And how does it support the
        map that we see in the same poster? Furthermore, how is the speed being
        simulated?
      </p>

      <p>
        These questions were fascinatingly explored by Ben H. Pearse
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4YjVmyFxTWYC&pg=PA106">
          in the February 1942 edition of Flying Magazine</a
        >, where he wrote an article on Navitrainers. Ben's explanation is the
        clearest of all and paints a vivid picture of how the Air Force cadets
        were interacting with this simulator. From his article:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The machine consists of a wooden frame about seven feet square, mounted
        on wheels two feet off the ground, and supporting a navigator's
        “cockpit” so constructed that it revolves through 360° around a drift
        meter tube extending up through the center. The wheels supporting the
        wooden frame are operated by an electric motor which can be speeded or
        slowed to simulate speeds of from 150 to 400 m.p.h in any direction of
        the compass. The motor is geared according to the scale of the map laid
        on the floor or on the Windtroducer beneath the frame, so that if the
        plane's average speed is 300 m.p.h., and the map scale is 10 miles to
        the inch,the Navitrainer will move 30 inches in an hour. With enough
        patience, a sofa pillow and a few chicken sandwiches in his pocket, the
        student can cross the Atlantic, circle the British Isles and return the
        same afternoon. If he is really ambitious, he might keep right on going
        and circumnavigate the world, without even running off the hangar floor.
        .....
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Below the frame is the Windtroducer, which at the will of the instructor
        produces all the vagaries of the wind with which the student navigator
        could possibly have to contend.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Fascinating indeed!</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        And that's it, folks! I encourage you to explore the Life magazine
        article and Ben's article in the Flying Magazine. Tangentially, I have
        been working on a
        <a href="https://github.com/pncnmnp/roger"
          >ground-based Air Traffic Simulator in Rust</a
        >. Please feel free to check it out and drop me your suggestions.

      <p>
        About a year and a half ago, I had the opportunity to take an NLP class
        at NC State taught by Prof. Munindar Singh. The class was absolutely
        fascinating, and it led me to discover more about the classical side of
        NLP.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my favorite discussions in his class was about the
        <i> Centering Theory</i>. This framework from the 90s was used, among
        many things, to model coherence in a text. The idea is to start by
        dividing the text into utterances, or sentences for simplicity, and
        identifying the <i>center</i>, which would be the most salient part of
        an utterance (usually an entity). Once we have the center, we can
        identify how it moves in future utterances. If it bounces around too
        much, we can say that the text is less coherent. The second edition of
        Jurafsky and Martin's
        <a href="https://github.com/rain1024/slp2-pdf"
          >Speech and Language Processing book</a
        >
        has a nice section on this topic, Section 18.1 on page 685.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also had some other interesting discussions, such as about languages
        that are not written (e.g.,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkani_language">Konkani</a>),
        whether there are any <i>true</i> synonyms, how French has a more
        prominent gender classification, and how the French government tries to
        regulate their language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, in his course, we were tasked with brainstorming and working on
        an NLP project. My colleague Anisha and I decided to work on reversing
        the twenty-questions game.
      </p>

      <h2>Reversing the Twenty Questions game</h2>
      <p><i>So, what is this game all about?</i></p>

      <p>
        Some of you may have heard of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions"
          >twenty-questions game</a
        >
        or a similar online version called
        <a href="https://en.akinator.com/">Akinator</a>. The game involves a
        <i>questioner</i> and an <i>answerer</i>. The answerer thinks of a
        random person, such as a famous movie star like <i>Tom Cruise</i>. The
        objective of the game is for the questioner to guess this person in less
        than twenty questions by asking a series of yes-no type questions to the
        answerer. For instance, is the person male? Is he a movie star? Has he
        acted in any superhero films? And so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, efficient computer programs like Akinator can act as the
        questioner to try and guess the entity we are thinking about. They
        usually use space-partitioning methods to select questions (based on
        previously answered questions) that are likely to drastically decrease
        the search space.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, we were trying to solve
        <i>a reverse version of this problem</i>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b
          >Make the computer randomly choose a name and let the human guess the
          name by asking the computer a series of natural language questions.
          The game ends when the human correctly guesses the name selected by
          the computer.
        </b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In our research, we developed an entire NLP pipeline that included an
        <i>entity formulation</i> and <i>pronoun resolution</i> phase, a
        <i> paragraph/sentence retrieval</i> phase, and a
        <i>boolean question-answering</i> phase. Initially, we encountered some
        difficulty when working with completely random entities, so we decided
        to limit the domain to commonly known animals. Although our results were
        not incredibly promising, they were not underwhelming either.
      </p>

        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways, I had given up on this variant of the game until today I
        decided to play it with ChatGPT. To my surprise, the results were
        absolutely mind-boggling!
      </p>

      <h2>ChatGPT playing Twenty Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Here are three games I played with ChatGPT today. Although it failed the
        first game, it made accurate predictions in the second and third games.
        The <i>italicized</i> text represents ChatGPT's responses.

      <h3>Game 1</h3>
      <p>
        Hey let us play a game of 20 questions where you think of someone in the
        film industry and I will try and guess who that person is. Ready?<br />
        <i>Sure, I'm ready! Go ahead and start.</i><br />
        <br />
        Is it a male?<br />

          he is not primarily known for acting in action films.</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        Does he act in drama films?<br />

          office revenue.</i

        <i>Yes, he has acted in a Martin Scorsese film.</i><br />
        <br />
        Was the film Goodfellas?<br />
        <i>No, he did not appear in Goodfellas.</i><br />
        <br />
        Has he acted in a film from Christopher Nolan?<br />
        <i>Yes, he has acted in a film directed by Christopher Nolan.</i><br />
        <br />
        I know the answer! Al Pacino!<br />
        <i
          >I'm sorry, but the person I was thinking of is not Al Pacino. Do you
          want to continue asking questions or make another guess?</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        I want to continue guessing, dont tell the answer<br />
        <i>Okay, feel free to ask another question!</i><br />
        <br />
        Was he in True Detectives?<br />
        <i>No, he did not appear in True Detective.</i><br />
        <br />
        Has he acted in Titanic?<br />
        <i>No, he did not appear in Titanic.</i><br />
        <br />
        Okay! I give up! Tell me the answer?<br />
        <i
          >The person I was thinking of is Anthony Hopkins. He is a Welsh actor
          known for his work in films such as The Silence of the Lambs (for
          which he won an Oscar), The Remains of the Day, and The Two Popes,
          among others. He has also appeared in TV shows like Westworld and
          Frasier, and in films directed by Christopher Nolan (The Prestige) and
          Martin Scorsese (The Edge of Darkness).</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        Wait what? Anthony Hopkins was not in The Prestige!<br />
        <i
          >I apologize for the mistake. You are correct, Anthony Hopkins did not
          appear in The Prestige. That was my error.</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        Uhh! That was why I was unable to guess<br />
        <i
          >I'm sorry about that. I made a mistake, which probably made the
          guessing game more difficult. If you want to play another round of the
          game, I'd be happy to participate and try to do better this time!</i
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see, there are quite a few issues with this conversation.
        It's worth noting that Martin Scorsese did not direct
        <i> The Edge of Darkness </i>; that was actually <i>Martin Campbell</i>.
        Additionally, it's important to point out that Anthony Hopkins did not
        appear in <i>The Prestige </i> or <i>Frasier</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>Game 2</h3>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        That's it, folks! I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post as much as I
        enjoyed writing it. With ChatGPT's remarkable capabilities, it's clear
        that much of the NLP research of the past will be superseded. And this
        is only the beginning! I'm excited to see what the future holds for this
        technology.

      <p>
        My poster collection is becoming grander and more interesting! In the
        past, I've written blogs about some of the more obscure posters I've
        collected from my local bookstore,
        <a href="https://www.hillsboroughstreet.org/go/readers-corner"
          >Reader's Corner</a
        >. These blogs covered topics like
        <a href="./navitrainer.html">one of the earliest flight simulators</a>
        used during World War II and the
        <a href="./addressograph.html">Addressograph</a>, a machine that
        automatically imprinted names, addresses, or other information on
        envelopes or forms, somewhat similar to what Xerox later offered.
      </p>

      <h2>The Poster</h2>
      <p>Today, we will explore the following poster:</p>
      <figure>
        <img width="75%" src="./pics/typewriter/typewriter-poster.jpg" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 1: My poster "But we’ll buy it back ... for Uncle Sam!"
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The poster is about a <b>Smith-Corona Typewriter Service</b> offering to
        buy back typewriters for the U.S. government due to a typewriter
        shortage during the war. The poster's description states the following:
      </p>

      <blockquote>But we’ll buy it back ... for Uncle Sam!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        We are neither making nor selling typewriters, these days. But the Army
        and Navy need over half a million more standard typewriters … on ships,
        in the field, at headquarters. Every report, every command, every
        requisition … here or abroad, aloft or undersea … must be typed. And
        there simply aren’t enough machines to go around.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        So … will you help? As a patriotic contribution, will you sell back
        every standard typewriter (made since Jan. 1, 1935) that you can
        possibly spare? Every Smith-Corona branch office is authorized by the
        Government to buy LC Smith machines at standard 1941 “trade-in” values …
        and your help is urgently invited.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Meanwhile, the typewriters you cannot spare must likewise be kept going
        full time. Don’t wait for breakdowns! Tell our branch or LC Smith dealer
        to send a service expert around … periodically. Let us keep your
        typewriters going for the duration.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>LC SMITH & CORONA TYPEWRITERS INC SYRACUSE NY</blockquote>

      <p>
        What's fascinating is that Smith-Corona is still in existence today.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Corona"
          >Wikipedia provides a great overview</a
        >
        of how they have managed to adapt through more than a century of innovation:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Once a large U.S. typewriter and mechanical calculator manufacturer,
        Smith Corona expanded aggressively during the 1960s to become a
        broad-based industrial conglomerate with products extending to paints,
        foods, and paper. The mechanical calculator sector was wiped out in the
        early 1970s by the production of inexpensive electronic calculators, and
        the typewriter business collapsed in the mid-1980s due to the digital
        revolution and PC-based word processing.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Smith Corona adapted by manufacturing word processing typewriters such
        as the PWP 1400 model. Its competitors were Brother, Olivetti, Silver
        Seiko, Adler, Olympia and IBM. In late 2010, Smith Corona entered the
        industrial ribbon and label market.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The company no longer manufactures typewriters or calculators, but does
        manufacture large quantities of barcode and shipping labels and the
        thermal ribbons used in thermal transfer printers.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        The years mentioned in the poster make it evident that the war being
        indirectly referenced is World War II. With a bit of scooby-dooing, I
        was able to narrow it down to
        <a
          href="https://archive.org/details/Life-1942-09-28-Vol-13-No-13/page/90/mode/2up"
          >Life magazine’s September 28, 1942 edition</a
        >
        - page 91. This was one year before the Allied invasion of Italy, two
        years before the D-Day invasion, and three years before the end of World
        War II.
      </p>

      <p>
        Commonly, during wars - and specifically in the U.S. during World War II
        - there was a significant pivot in industrial output from civilian to
        military production to support the Allied forces. Factories initially
        dedicated to consumer goods were repurposed to manufacture weapons,
        aircraft, and other military equipment. Furthermore, the war led to
        labor shortages, with millions of Americans enlisted in the military,
        significantly reducing the civilian workforce.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, Smith-Corona wasn't the only typewriter service to run
        such advertisements. John Bush Jones discusses this incident in his book
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv102bg4q">
          All-Out for Victory!: Magazine Advertising and the World War II Home
          Front</a
        >.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Virtually all conservation ads in the leading general-interest magazines
        were aimed at civilian consumers. But there was also a small group that
        targeted the business community, all — with the exception of ads on how
        to keep one’s Mimeograph machine up and running — dealing with one
        particular article — typewriters. Some of these ads had a character, and
        an angle, all their own. During the war, America’s three leading
        typewriter manufacturers — Underwood, Smith-Corona, and Royal — were
        not, of course, manufacturing typewriters but were engaged in various
        kinds of war production. Accordingly, the ads of all three companies
        (very few by Underwood, incidentally) focused on how individuals and
        businesses could keep their typewriters in good working order so that
        they would hold up until new machines could be produced. But in the late
        summer and fall of 1942 a new dimension was added to the Royal and
        Smith-Corona ads typified by the words in Royal’s ad in Life on August
        24, 1942, headed, “Brother can you spare a typewriter to help win the
        war?”: “We’re not selling Royal Typewriters today . . . WE’RE BUYING
        ’EM! The United States Government is in urgent need of 600,000
        typewriters — for use by the Army … the Navy ... the Air Corps … the
        Marine Corps. These machines are needed for speeding up war production
        and the movement of supplies — transmitting orders to troops on land . .
        . ships at sea . . . even planes in the air. The typed message is the
        fastest, most reliable means of written communication! Typewriters are
        essential to Victory!” (103). This ad and the others by both Royal and
        Smith-Corona explained their buy-back scheme in which all standard (not
        portable) typewriters of their own manufacture made since January 1,
        1935, would be purchased at their 1941 trade-in value regardless of the
        shape they were in, to be reconditioned and sent to the government for
        distribution to the armed forces. This program appears to be the only
        case of conserved, still usable equipment — not scrap — going directly
        into the business of fighting the war.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Digging a bit deeper, I found a booklet from August 1942, titled
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=E_8LdAD611YC"
          >Rationing: Why and How</a
        >, which was published by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Price_Administration"
          >Office of Price Administration (OPA)</a
        >. OPA was created by Roosevelt a year earlier on August 28, 1941,
        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/rationing-in-wwii.htm"
          >its purpose was to</a
        >
        “place a ceiling on prices of most goods, and to limit consumption by
        rationing.” Here’s what the booklet said about the typewriter shortage:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Typewriters: Typewriter manufacturing plants were well suited for
        conversion to the production of rifle, pistol, and machine-gun parts, as
        well as other items essential to the war. This fact and war needs for
        the metals which normally go into typewriters resulted, early in 1942,
        in the curtailment of typewriter production and its complete stoppage a
        few months later. All new production since March has gone directly to
        the armed forces. Indeed the Government launched in July a program to
        buy half a million used machines for the Army and Navy. To assure that
        the needs of war contractors and other essential agencies are met, the
        Government has rationed typewriters.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Nonportable typewriters may be secured by firms which are primarily
        engaged in military construction or war production. Portables may be
        purchased by the same eligibles, and in addition, by Government
        agencies, newspapers, and radio stations, communications services, Red
        Cross, Office of Civilian Defense, and other essential war services.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Certificates to buy available typewriters may be secured upon
        application to the local War Price and Rationing Board.

          donate scrap rubber. In addition to typewriters and rubber, the Office

          processed foods, and meat. This image is from

      <h2>What Followed?</h2>
      <p>
        By December, the stock situation seemed to be even more dire. So much so
        that on December 5, 1942, the then Price Administrator, Leon Henderson,
        acted to make additional typewriters available to the armed services
        from the country’s severely limited stocks.
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jSXHMVItfQMC">
          A press release from the Office of War Information</a
        >, published in the Saturday morning papers, laid all of this out in
        much finer detail. It states that:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Explaining that manufacture of typewriters has been practically halted
        by the War Production Board and that the heavy demands of the Army and
        Navy must be filled from typewriters now in the hands of the trade and
        of users. Mr. Henderson put into immediate effect an amendment of OPA's
        typewriter rationing regulations which:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Forbids the sale to civilians of all standard typewriters except
            obsolete models and “stripped” portables; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Restricts rentals of non-portable typewriters to those made before
            January 1, 1935.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Under the ruling (Amendment No. 7 to Ration Order 4), typewriter sales
        from today on may be made only to members of the trade and to the
        Procurement Division of the Treasury Department - the authorized agents
        for the Army, Navy, and other government agencies essential to the war
        effort - and to those persons authorized to buy typewriters for export.
        It is estimated that about 125,000 typewriters in the hands of dealers
        and manufacturers will be made available under today's amendment.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Persons now holding typewriter certificates are permitted to make
        purchases, providing they do so by January 1.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Anyway, the 1947 book
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xPeWauyWbmgC"
          >Field Administration of Wartime Rationing</a
        >
        by Emmette S. Redford mentions that consumer rationing of typewriters
        lasted until April 1944. This can be further corroborated by exploring
        an
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3L3fG0g0-K4C"
          >April 20, 1944 press release</a
        >
        from the Office of Price Administration:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Used typewriters and new typewriters in the hands of dealers will not be
        rationed after April 22, 1944, the Office of Price Administration
        announced today. OPA officials emphasized that today's action does not
        affect distibution of new typewriters in the hands of manufacturers,
        which continue to be controlled by the War Production Board.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        “Abandonment of typewriter rationing is in keeping with our general
        policy to relax rationing rules whenever the situation warrants it,” OPA
        Administrator Chester Bowles said. “An analysis of current trade
        inventories and the activity of local War Price and Rationing Boards in
        granting certificates for typewriter rentals, indicates that typewriter
        rationing is no longer necessary.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        OPA's latest statistical report shows that, in 14 months, 4,052
        certificates for rentals of typewriters have been granted, covering
        15,177 machines. This amounts to about 10 per cent of all used machines,
        built since 1928, in the hands of the trade. Inventory reports also show
        that even where machines were released for unrestricted sale, many of
        them remained in dealers' stocks as a part of the used typewriter pool
        for rental purposes. A contributing factor to the favorable supply
        situation was a limited increase in new typewriter production, begun
        late last year, which is providing new machines for the most urgent
        civilian needs. The conclusion of the Government's program of acquiring
        used typewriters for the armed forces also eased the pressure of demand.
      </blockquote>

          "It was magnificent," he said, as he took his seat. "Do you remember

        A few weeks back, while browsing Hacker News’
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/pool">second chance pool</a>, I
        came across a
        <a
          href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/how-to-shuffle-songs/"
          >2014 blog post from Spotify</a
        >
        discussing how to shuffle songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, at first glance, you might think, “How challenging could it be to
        shuffle songs in a playlist? Can we not randomly shuffle them out?”
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, that’s precisely the approach Spotify initially took. They used
        the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle"
          >Fisher–Yates shuffle</a
        >
        to do this. Say you have five songs from three artists, as illustrated
        in the figure below:
      </p>
      <figure>

        />
        <figcaption>
          <i>Figure 1: 5 songs from 3 artists in a playlist</i>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The modern implementation of Fisher–Yates shuffle is an \(O(n)\) time
        algorithm and can be described as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style: none">
          To shuffle an array \(a\) of \(n\) elements (indices \(0..n-1\)):
        </li>
        <li style="list-style: none">
          For \(i\) from \(n - 1\) down to \(1\) do
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            \(j \leftarrow \) random integer such that \( 0 \le j \le i \)
          </li>
          <li>exchange \(a[j]\) and \(a[i]\)</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>Using the figure above, we can visualize the algorithm:</p>

        Now, this was all fine for the Sweden-based team till they faced a
        fascinating issue. In their words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ..... We noticed some users complaining about our shuffling algorithm
        playing a few songs from the same artist right after each other. The
        users were asking “Why isn’t your shuffling random?”. We responded “Hey!
        Our shuffling is random!”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        At first we didn’t understand what the users were trying to tell us by
        saying that the shuffling is not random, but then we read the comments
        more carefully and noticed that some people don’t want the same artist
        playing two or three times within a short time period.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        ..... If you just heard a song from a particular artist, that doesn’t
        mean that the next song will be more likely from a different artist in a
        perfectly random order. However, the old saying says that the user is
        always right, so we decided to look into ways of changing our shuffling
        algorithm so that the users are happier. We learned that they don’t like
        perfect randomness.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Fascinating indeed! To create an illusion of randomness -
        <i>randomness with artists evenly spread throughout the playlist</i> -
        the engineers drew inspiration from a
        <a href="https://keyj.emphy.de/balanced-shuffle/"
          >2007 blog-post by Martin Fiedler</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fiedler’s algorithm is divided into two parts:
        <b>the merge algorithm</b> and <b>the fill algorithm</b>. Initially, the
        songs to be shuffled are <i>categorized</i> based on their artist. For
        instance, assume that we now have three artists and ten songs in our
        playlist. Then,
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./pics/fibonacci-hashing/categorization-step.png"
          alt="Categorization step"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i
            >Figure 3: Categorization step in Fiedler’s algorithm using 10 songs
            from 3 artists.</i
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The <i>fill algorithm</i> aims to distribute dummy tracks evenly among
        shorter categories to match the length of the longest one. This step is
        followed by the <i>merge algorithm</i>, which combines tracks from
        different categories to form a single playlist in a column-wise fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, with the categories mentioned earlier, the fill algorithm
        would:
      </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Subsequently, the merge algorithm would create a final playlist as
        follows:
      </p>

          src="./pics/fibonacci-hashing/merge-algorithm.png"

      <p>
        While this method distributes the songs quite efficiently, as mentioned
        by Spotify, it is complicated and potentially slow in certain scenarios,
        particularly due to the numerous randomization operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spotify suggested drawing inspiration from existing dithering
        algorithms, like
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering"
          >Floyd–Steinberg dithering</a
        >, to spread each artist as evenly as possible. Although they don't
        provide specific details of their algorithm, the basic concept they
        describe is as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Let’s say we have 4 songs from The White Stripes as in the picture
        above. This means that they should appear roughly every 25% of the
        length of the playlist. We spread out the 4 songs along a line, but
        their distance will vary randomly from about 20% to 30% to make the
        final order look more random.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        We introduce a random offset in the beginning; otherwise all first songs
        would end up at position 0.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        We also shuffle the songs by the same artist among each other. Here we
        can use Fisher-Yates shuffle or apply the same algorithm recursively,
        for example we could prevent songs from the same album playing too close
        to each other.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After reading Spotify’s blog post, an idea struck me! You see, a year
        ago, I wrote a small library to generate aesthetically pleasing colors
        in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"
          >HSV (hue, saturation, value) space</a
        >.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./pics/fibonacci-hashing/hsv-space.png"
          alt="HSV color space"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i
            >Figure 6: HSV color space. This image is
            <a

            >.</i
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        But how do we define "aesthetically pleasing colors"? And what's the
        connection to shuffling algorithms?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider an example where we need to pick five colors to label a
        chart. Choosing these colors randomly from the RGB space can be quite
        problematic. Some colors, especially on darker backgrounds, can make
        text hard to read. Moreover, it is possible to end up with colors that
        are too similar to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Addressing the issue of dark or light backgrounds turns out to be
        relatively straightforward – <i>avoid the RGB space</i> and instead,
        <i>use the HSV space with fixed saturation and value</i>. However, even
        then, there's a high chance of selecting colors that are too close on
        the color spectrum. In other words,
        <b>the selection can be too random</b>, and we might prefer colors that
        are distributed as evenly as possible across the entire color spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, my library employed <b>Fibonacci hashing</b>. The
        algorithm I implemented
        <a
          href="https://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/"
          >was proposed by Martin Leitner‑Ankerl</a
        >. It utilizes the <b>golden ratio</b>: \[ \Phi = \dfrac{\sqrt{5} -
        1}{2} \approx 0.618033988749895 \]
      </p>

      <p>
        As Martin explains in his blog, one of the intriguing properties of the
        golden ratio is that
        <i>
          each subsequent hash value divides the interval into which it falls in
          accordance with the golden ratio!
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        To better understand Fibonacci hashing, let us explore it through the
        perspective of Donald Knuth’s
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming"
          >The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foundation of Fibonacci hashing is based upon the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-gap_theorem">
          three-distance theorem </a
        >. This theorem states: Suppose \(\theta\) is an irrational number. When
        the points \(\theta\), \((2*theta) % 1\), ….., \((n*theta) % 1\) are
        placed on a line segment ranging from \(0\) to \(1\) (inclusive), the
        \(n + 1\) line segments formed will have at most three distinct lengths.
        Furthermore, the next point \(((n+1)*theta) % 1\) will fall into one of
        the largest existing segments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the largest existing segment, spanning from \(a\) to \(c\)
        (inclusive), being divided into two parts: \(a\) to \(b\) and \(b\) to
        \(c\). If one of these parts is more than twice the length of the other,
        we call this division a bad break. Using the three-distance theorem, it
        can be shown that the two numbers \(\Phi\) (<b>the golden ratio!</b>)
        and \(1 - \Phi\) lead to the most uniformly distributed sequences among
        all numbers \(\theta\) between \(0\) and \(1\). In other words, a break
        break will occur unless \(\Phi\) or \(1 - \Phi\) are used.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that’s it! We can start at a random hue value between 0 and 1 and
        use the Fibonacci hashing from that point to evenly select colors on the
        color spectrum.
      </p>

        So how can we apply all of this to shuffle songs? Well, the algorithm I
        came up with is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Categorization Function:</b> Let \(S\) be the set of all songs in
          the playlist. Define a categorization function \(C: S \rightarrow A\),
          where \(A\) is the set of artists. This function assigns each song in
          \(S\) to an artist in \(A\).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Shuffle Songs per Artist:</b> For each artist \(a \in A\), shuffle
          the subset of \(S\) where \(C(s) = A\) for all \(s\) in the subset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Shuffle Artist List:</b> Let \(A’\) be the list of all artists.
          Apply a random permutation \(\pi\) to \(A’\).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Initialize Playlist \(P\)</b>: Let \(P\) be an empty list that will
          store the final shuffled songs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Set Parameters:</b> Initialize \(K=1\) and let \(N = |A|\) (the
          total number of artists).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Select Artist Index:</b> Compute the index \(I = \lfloor ((K *
          0.618033988749895) % 1) * N) \rfloor \).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Songs to \(P\)</b>: Remove the first song from the list of
          songs corresponding to the artist at \(A’[I]\) and append it to \(P\).
        </li>
        <li><b>Update Parameters:</b> Increment \(K\) by 1.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Update Artist List:</b> If the artist at \(A’[I]\) has no remaining
          songs, decrement \(N\) by 1 and remove the artist from \(A’\).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Loop Through:</b> Repeat steps 6 to 9 until \(A’\) is empty. When
          empty, return \(P\).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./pics/fibonacci-hashing/shuffle-with-fibonacci-hashing.png"
          alt="Algorithm for shuffling songs using Fibonacci hashing"
        />
        <figcaption>
          <i
            >Figure 9: An illustration of the above algorithm for shuffling
            songs using Fibonacci hashing.</i
          >
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        If we use a hash table in the categorization function and an array to
        store the list of all artists, then the overall time complexity of the
        algorithm would be \(O(S)\).
      </p>
      <p>
        To compare this algorithm against the naive Fisher-Yates shuffle, I used
        a measure that calculates the ratio of the count of adjacent song pairs
        by the same artist to the total number of songs in the playlist minus
        one. That is,
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">def measure(shuffled_songs):
    clusters = sum(
        1
        for i in range(len(shuffled_songs) - 1)
        if shuffled_songs[i][‘artist’] == shuffled_songs[i + 1][‘artist’]
    )
    return clusters / (len(shuffled_songs) - 1)    
</code></pre>
      <p>
        When the playlist contains songs only from one artist, this measure will
        be 1. Conversely, when no adjacent song pairs are by the same artist,
        the measure will return 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using fuzzy testing on a maximum of ten artists, with each having up to
        ten songs, I generated a million playlists and calculated the statistics
        for the above algorithm (A) and the fisher-yates shuffle (B). The
        results were as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A - Mean: 0.11831, Median: 0.05263, Mode: 0.0, p25: 0.02040, p75:
          0.14814, p90: 0.33333, p95: 0.5
        </li>
        <li>
          B - Mean: 0.23296, Median: 0.18181, Mode: 0.33333, p25: 0.12121, p75:
          0.29629, p90: 0.46666, p95: 0.58333
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At first glance, the p95 result might seem surprising. However, this
        occurs in cases where the fuzzy testing populates a playlist
        predominantly with songs from a single artist, rendering optimal
        shuffling infeasible. When a minimum of four songs per artist were used,
        the results were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A - Mean: 0.05948, Median: 0.03703, Mode: 0.0, p25: 0.01694, p75:
          0.07843, p90: 0.14285, p95: 0.2
        </li>
        <li>
          B - Mean: 0.17223, Median: 0.15555, Mode: 0.2, p25: 0.10909, p75:
          0.21875, p90: 0.29268, p95: 0.34482
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The results look decent. I’d expect Fiedler’s algorithm to have a
        near-zero mean, however, the simplicity and speed of the above algorithm
        does look appealing to me.

        And that’s it folks! I hope you enjoyed this little journey. Happy
        exploring!

        Recently, I was exploring the “History” section in Knuth’s TAOCP volume
        3 to trace back the history of hashing. In it, Knuth states that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The idea of hashing appears to have been originated by H. P. Luhn, who
        wrote an internal IBM memorandum in January 1953 that suggested the use
        of chaining; in fact, his suggestion was one of the first applications
        of linked linear lists.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I couldn't locate the memo. It seems they never made it
        public. However, I stumbled upon a nice paper from 1953 in which he
        discusses
        <a href="http://jonathanstray.com/papers/Luhn-SearchEngine-1953.pdf"
          >enhancing search engines by refining sets</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knuth also references Arnold I. Dumey, who appears to be the first to
        describe hash tables in open literature.
        <a

        >
          I was able to retrieve his paper </a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dumey initiates with an \(O(log\; n)\) solution using the "twenty
        questions" game, subsequently explaining how we'd be better off if we
        could do computation before we access the memory. I found his
        introduction to the hash function rather intriguing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        A certain manufacturing company had a parts and assemblies list of many
        thousands of items. A mixed digital and alphabetic system of numbering
        items was used, of six positions in all. Eight complex machines or
        assemblies were sold to the public. These had item numbers taken from
        the general system. In setting up a punch card control system on these
        eight items it was first proposed to record the entire six digit number
        for each item. However, examination of the eight assembly numbers
        disclosed that no two were alike on the fourth digit. It was therefore
        sufficient, for sorting purposes, merely to record the fourth digit,
        thereby releasing five badly needed information spaces for other
        purposes.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        This rather extreme case indicates that an examination of the item
        description may disclose a built-in redunancy which can be used to cut
        the field down to practical size.
      </blockquote>
      <p>He further discusses handling duplicates and introduces chaining:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Adjust the addressing scheme, according to a method which will be
        described later, to reduce the number of direct addresses, and use the
        excess locations to store overflows. Put the overflow address at the
        tail end of stored item information. What the best reduction is varies
        from case to case. Note that the expectation of the number of accesses
        to be made goes up when these methods are used. At each access we check
        by using the complete item description, usually.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        And discusses how a somewhat efficient hash address can be constructed
        by dividing a prime number and using the remainder:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Consider the item description as though it were a number in the scale of
        37 or whatever. Or write it as a binary number by using the appropriate
        punched tape coding. Divide this number by a number slightly less than
        the number of addressable locations (the writer prefers the nearest
        prime). Throw away the quotient. Use the remainder as the address,
        adjusting to base 10, as the case may be.

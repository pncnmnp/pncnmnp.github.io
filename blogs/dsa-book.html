      <h1>The Secret World of Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>
      <h2>Author: <a href="../index.html">Parth Parikh</a></h2>

        <i>
          This book is not meant to serve as an introduction to algorithms and
          data structures, nor is there any coherence in the sequence of the
          chapters. Instead, it is like visiting an adventure park where each
          ride explores fascinating and lesser-known worlds of algorithms and
          data structures. I have selected these rides simply because I love
          them, and I hope that you will find them enjoyable too.</i

            techniques.

          I got this breathtaking picture from
          <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/UwzalTDCpT4">Jared Rice</a>, who
          took this image in <i>Yucatan, Mexico</i>. In one of his image
          descriptions, he wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <i
            >The feeling of this place is like a dream, I have never felt like I
            was transported to a different world quite like this. Walking out
            onto the edge of this walkway you lose the distraction of the
            outside world, you are forced to focus on the silence; all you can
            hear is the soft sounds of water moving over your feet. There are
            small fish that seemingly circle you. The water is ever bit this
            teal color and the sun ray illuminates this underground cenote. I
            can see why the mayans viewed these places as sacred.</i

      <h1>Tangoing with a Martin Gardner Word Game</h1>
      <h2>First Published: 28/01/24</h2>
      <p>
        It's fascinating how, out of the blue, we sometimes discover something
        so tangential yet interesting that we stop whatever we're doing to
        pursue that idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday, while researching bit arrays, I came across
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/366786.366795">
          a 1961 article in the Communications of the ACM</a
        >
        by Anatol W. Holt. Having never heard of Holt, I naturally decided to
        explore his works on Google Scholar and Google Books. That's when I
        stumbled upon
        <a
          href="https://archive.org/details/sim_scientific-american_1969-04_220_4/page/124/mode/2up"
          >Martin Gardner's 1969 column, "Mathematical Games"</a
        >, published in Scientific American.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the April edition, in which Gardner had laid out eight problems
        based on logic and probability. A central theme amongst many of them was
        that the problem involved some sort of game - such as chess, name cards,
        and word games.
        <i> To call these problems intriguing would be an understatement </i> -
        there's an uncrossed knight's tour problem, a variant of chess where the
        first person to check the opponent's king wins, a variant of the urn
        problem, and, of course, the topic of this blog - a word game.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s the word game:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Anatol W. Holt, director of advanced systems for Applied Data Research,
        Inc., is a mathematician who makes a hobby of inventing games. His board
        game MEM, played with 32 stones of 11 colors, is a delightful strategy
        game based on a completely new idea involving pattern recognition. (It
        is currently on sale in stores and can also be ordered postpaid for
        $6.50 from Holt’s own firm, Stelledar, Inc., 1700 Walnut Street,
        Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.)
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        A few years ago, Holt devised the following word game. Two people each
        think of a “target word” with the same number of letters. Beginners
        should start with three-letter words and then go on to longer words as
        their skill improves. Players take turns calling out a “probe word” of
        the agreed length. The opponent must respond by saying whether the
        number of “hits” (right letter at the right position) is odd or even.
        The first to guess his opponent’s word is the winner. To show how
        logical analysis can determine the word without guesswork, Holt has
        supplied the following example of six probe words given by one
        player:<br />
        Even: Day, May, Buy <br />Odd: Say, Due, Ten
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        If you knew the target word and compared it letter by letter with any
        word on the even list, you would find that an even number of letters
        (zero counts as even) in each probe would match letters at the same
        positions in the target word; words on the odd list would match the
        target word in an odd number of positions. Find the target word.
      </blockquote>

        <i>
          Let's not be mimes! Go ahead, pick up your pencils, and start
          brainstorming.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This past Christmas, I played a "cannot count, but it's a lot" amount of
        NYT word games with my family. I must confess, I even tried building my
        own Wordle variants, but I couldn't come up with something as
        interesting and simple as this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A natural solution can be derived by examining the similarities and
        differences between the odd and even probe words. Take, for example,
        "Day," which is even, and "Say," which is odd. Since the "-ay" suffix is
        consistent, it indicates that "S" is the first letter in the target
        word. Further, considering "Due," "Day," and "Buy," we deduce that "u"
        cannot be in the middle, and "D" cannot be at the start, as previously
        observed. This leaves "e" from the odd word "Due," suggesting that "e"
        is the last letter in the target word. Having determined both the first
        and last letters, we then look at "Ten." As it is an odd word and "e" is
        the middle letter, we can conclude that "e" is also the central letter
        in the target word. <i>Therefore, the target word is "See"</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          This can easily be turned into an NYT-esque word game, where the
          computer thinks of a three-letter dictionary word (or four, to make it
          more challenging) at random, and our task is to guess the word while
          the computer gives us odd/even hints. The fewer the number of guesses
          it takes to find the target word, the better.
        </i>
        It's a surprisingly fun game!
      </p>
      <p>This is a short Python program for playing the game:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-python">import random
from nltk.corpus import words

def get_word(length=3):
    return random.choice([w for w in words.words() if len(w) == length]).lower()

def check(guess, answer):
    return "Even" if sum(g == a for g, a in zip(guess, answer)) % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

def play():
    answer = get_word()
    try:
        while (guess := input("Guess: ")) != answer:
            print(f"It's {check(guess, answer)}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        print(f"The word was {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play()
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now, here's an interesting question:
        <i> how can we solve it computationally? </i>
      </p>

      <p>For a three-letter target word, an algorithm can be as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by making random three-letter guesses from a dictionary.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Continue guessing until you receive feedback indicating that the
              guessed word is an "odd probe word" (i.e., it has either one or
              three matching letters with the target word). If all three letters
              match, the problem is solved.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the odd probe word from Step 1 and generate variations of this
          word by changing one letter at a time while keeping the other two
          letters constant. For example, if “nay” is an odd probe word, generate
          variations such as “say”, “nap”, and “noy”.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>For each variation, make a guess and observe the feedback.</li>
            <li>
              Identify the letter that, when changed, results in an "even probe
              word" feedback. This letter is the first matching letter in the
              target word.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, make guesses keeping the identified matching letter (and its
          position) constant from Step 2, while changing the other two letters.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              Continue until you receive feedback indicating an "even probe
              word."
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply the same process as in Step 2 to identify the second
              matching letter.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          With two letters already identified, use a dictionary to make the
          last-letter guesses until you find the target word.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The problem becomes surprisingly complex when we restrict step 2 to only
        allow guesses of words found in a dictionary. This limitation means we
        cannot always generate variations while keeping the other letters
        constant. This complexity isn't immediately evident in the three-letter
        version; however, when we move to four or more letters, it becomes much
        harder. Dare I say, <i>the problem even becomes NP</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think about it! The odd/even feedback we get does not directly indicate
        which letters are correct or their positions. This uncertainty leads to
        a combinatorial explosion of possibilities as the word length increases.
        With each guess, we only partially constrain the solution space, and in
        the worst case, many guesses might be needed to converge on the correct
        word. I plan to ponder more on this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, <i>every world builder gets to name their town</i>. Since the
        original authors are likely not present anymore, I'd like to propose a
        name for it - <b>Yinique</b>!

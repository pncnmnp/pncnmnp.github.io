        All four individuals made interesting early contributions to a
        mathematical structure that we now know as a <b>tree</b>. In this blog
        post, we will briefly explore their unique contributions and see how the
        tree structure was introduced in both mathematics and computer science.

      <h2>Gustav Kirchhoff and Karl G. C. von Staudt</h2>
      <p>
        Before we dive into Kirchhoff’s contribution, let us review what a free
        tree and a fundamental cycle are.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <b>free tree</b> is a connected graph with no designated root and no
        cycles, hence its alternate name, an <i>unrooted tree</i>. This
        distinguishes it from an
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory)
        "
          ><i>arborescence</i></a
        >, which consists of a designated root node.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there are many intuitive definitions of a fundamental cycle,
        one of the simplest comes from
        <a
          href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/963054/what-is-a-fundamental-cycle-of-a-graph/963628
        "
          >Casteels on Math Exchange</a
        >:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Let \(G\) be a connected graph, and let \(T\) be a spanning tree of
        \(G\). Let \(e\) be an edge in \(G\) between vertices \(v\) and \(w\)
        that is not in \(T\). Now in \(T\) there is a unique path between \(v\)
        and \(w\), and since \(e\) is not in \(T\), that path does not use
        \(e\). Therefore, that path together with \(e\) forms a cycle in \(G\).
        A cycle built this way is called a fundamental cycle.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here is a neat visualization of the same:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/history-trees/fundamental-cycle.png" />
        <figcaption>Figure 1: Example of a fundamental cycle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        So, what is the relation between free trees, fundamental cycles, and
        Gustav Kirchhoff? Well, as mentioned in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming"
          >Donald Knuth’s TAOCP Volume 1</a
        >, Gustav Kirchhoff was one of the first
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1086426">
          to use free trees to find a set of fundamental cycles in an electrical
          network</a
        >. His 1847 paper also formed the basis for the now ubiquitous
        Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kirchhoff used \(m\) to denote the number of junctions (nodes) and \(n\)
        to denote the number of branches (edges). While stating Theorem 2, he
        mentioned the equation \(\mu = n - m + 1\), which finds the number of
        fundamental cycles in a graph \( \mu \). Furthermore, the number of
        equations needed for Kirchhoff’s Voltage law (Theorem 1 in the paper) is
        given by the least number of edges that must be removed from the graph
        for all the cycles to be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, Donald Knuth also cites Karl G. C. von Staudt’s
        <a href="https://archive.org/details/geometriederlage00stauuoft">
          1847 work Geometrie der Lage</a
        >
        (pages 20 and 21) as an early contribution to the field of trees. In his
        work, von Staudt showed proof of Euler's polyhedron formula, \( n - e +
        f =2 \), where \(n\) is the number of vertices, \(e\) is the number of
        edges, and \(f\) is the number of faces. Euler mentioned his result in a
        letter to Christian Goldbach in 1750; however,
        <a href="https://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/abhijit/623/euler_slides.pdf">
          he did not give the first correct proof of his formula</a
        >. The French mathematician Adrian Marie Legendre is often cited as
        having given the first correct proof of this formula, somewhere in 1794.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what was von Staudt’s contribution? As it turns out, von Staudt
        presented proof of Euler's polyhedron formula that relied on the use of
        trees. Although the original text is in German,
        <a href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/">Robin Whitty</a> has neatly
        summarized the proof in one of his "<a
          href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/GeometryAndTrigonometry/EulerPolyhedral/TotDEuler.pdf
        "
          >Theorem of the Day</a
        >" posts:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        For graph \(G\), take the dual graph \(G*\) whose vertices are the plane
        faces and whose edges join dual vertices by crossing edges of \(G\).
        Take a spanning tree \(T\) in \(G\): it has \(n\) vertices and \(n - 1\)
        edges. The remaining edges of \(G\) are crossed by a spanning tree
        \(T*\) of \(G*\): it has \(f\) vertices and \(f - 1\) edges. Every edge
        of \(G\) is in \(T\) or is crossed by an edge of \(T*\). So \(e = (n -
        1) + (f - 1)\).
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Arthur Cayley</h2>
      <p>
        It was not until ten years later, in 1857, that Arthur Cayley formulated
        the term "tree" in his paper "<a
          href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MlEEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA172&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false"
          >On the theory of the analytical forms called trees.</a
        >" Over three decades (1857-89), he published a series of papers on the
        theory of trees and their applications. As stated by Donald Knuth,
        Cayley seemed to be unaware of the previous work of Kirchhoff and von
        Staudt. His investigations mainly involved the study of isomers in
        chemistry and the structure of algebraic formulas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cayley’s 1857 contribution was using trees as an organizational tool for
        differentiation. This is succinctly expressed by
        <a
          href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/46/Pengelley_projects/Project-12/12-networks-trees.pdf
        "
        >
          Prof. Gerald M. Lodder at NMSU</a
        >:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        In an 1857 publication [9], Cayley introduces the term “tree” to
        describe the logical branching that occurs when iterating the
        fundamental procedure of differentiation. Calculus is not the main
        concern here, but instead an organizational tool is developed that
        provides a visual overview of the individual terms under
        differentiation. This tool is used today in quite different situations
        from networks in computer science to finding efficient delivery routes
        in the transportation industry. To introduce Cayley’s paper, let
        \(\partial_x\) denote differentiation with respect to \(x\) and let
        \(\partial_y\) denote differentiation with respect to \(y\). Then
        \(\partial_x(x^2 y) = 2xy\) and \(\partial_y(x^2y) = x^2\), given that
        \(x\) and \(y\) are independent variables. The symbols \(\partial_x\)
        and \(\partial_y\) are called operators, while the expression \(x^2 y\)
        itself is an operand. Note that the symbols \(\partial_x\) and
        \(\partial_y\) are applied to (operate on) functions written to the
        right of the symbol. If the function is written to the left, such as
        \(x^2 y \partial_x\), Cayley dubs the entire expression an operandator,
        and \(x^2 y\) remains unaltered by the operator on the right. Cayley
        wishes to study how operandators interact among themselves. Let \(P =
        x^2 y \partial_x\) and \(Q = xy \partial_y\). Then PQ is the operandator
        given by \[PQ = x^2 y \partial_x(xy \partial_y) = x^2 y(y \partial_y) =
        x^2y^2\partial_y\] and \(QP\) is the operandator given by \[QP = xy
        \partial_y(x^2y \partial_x) = xy(x^2\partial_x) = x^3y\partial_x\] In
        the above example, \(QP \ne PQ\). For operandators \(Q\), \(P\), \(U\),
        what should be the meaning of \(QPU\)? Do the groupings \(Q(PU)\) and
        \((QP)U\) yield the same result, with \(Q\), \(P\), and \(U\) are in the
        same relative order?
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here is the relevant part from Cayley’s 1857 paper:</p>

          term "trees".

      </figure>
      <p>
        Later, in 1874, Cayley published another paper wherein he used trees to
        enumerate the isomers of compounds of form \(C_n H_{2n+2}\).
      </p>

      <h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>
      <p>
        Charles Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, made a
        fascinating observation in the theory of trees. In 1972, W. W. Bartley
        \(III\)
        <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24927382"
          >published a paper on Carroll's lost book on logic</a
        >, which contained the <b>Method of Trees</b>, one of the earliest uses
        of truth trees to prove or refute a logical formula.
      </p>

        <img src="./pics/history-trees/carroll-tree.png" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 4: Carroll’s take on why mathematical trees should grow
          head-downwards.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Nowadays, truth trees are widely used to prove theorems, analyze the
        logical structure of mathematical proofs, and formalize the rules of
        grammar in artificial intelligence and linguistics. While discussing the
        Method of Trees, W. W. Bartley \(III\) writes the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        METHOD OF TREES was developed by Dodgson as a means of testing the
        validity of a conclusion derived from premises. It is strikingly similar
        to the "trees" frequently used by contemporary logicians. The basic idea
        is to assume that the premises are true but the conclusion is false (and
        its denial is true). If combining the denial of the conclusion with the
        premises leads to an absurdity, it shows that the premises do indeed
        prove the conclusion. The explanation here has been reset from the
        section describing "The Method of Trees " in Dodgson's unpublished work.
        It deals with a simple tree that does not require branching.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Interestingly, in his discussion of the Method of Trees, W. W. Bartley
        \(III\) notes that Lewis Carroll applied this method to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_dilemma">
          the Crocodile dilemma
        </a>
        in his unpublished work.

      </figure>
      <p>
        A curious reader can explore more about Carroll’s approach in Bartley’s
        paper.
      </p>

      <h2>H. G. Kahrimanian</h2>
      <p>
        Donald Knuth mentions something fascinating in TAOCP about the history
        of trees in computer science:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Tree structures represented explicitly in computer memory were
        originally used for applications to algebraic formula manipulation. The
        machine language for several early computers used a three-address code
        to represent the computation of arithmetic expressions; the latter is
        equivalent to the <code>INFO</code>, <code>LLINK</code>, and
        <code>RLINK</code> of a binary tree representation. In 1952, H. G.
        Kahrimanian developed algorithms for differentiating algebraic formulas
        represented in an extended three-address code; see Symposium on
        Automatic Programming (Washington, D.C.: Office of Naval Research, May
        1954), 6–14. <br />
        Since then, tree structures in various guises have been studied
        independently by many people in connection with numerous computer
        applications .....
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This might make H. G. Kahrimanian's 1952 paper one of the earliest
        references to a tree-like structure (in guise) in computing.
        Interestingly, for a long time, I thought that his thesis was lost. Then
        a few months back, I came across the proceedings of the 1954 Symposium
        on Automatic Programming on Google Books. And sure enough, inside it was
        Kahrimanian’s paper Analytical Differentiation by a Digital Computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little is known about Harry G. Kahrimanian beyond the fact that he
        completed his Master's thesis at Temple University in 1953 and later
        worked at the Naval Aviation Supply Office in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania. However,
        <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/kurt-w-beyer/"
          >Kurt W. Beyer</a
        >'s book
        <a
          href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262517263/grace-hopper-and-the-invention-of-the-information-age/"
          >Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age</a
        >
        contains fascinating information about him:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Hopper had the habit of assigning the most difficult technical problems
        to the youngest and least experienced members of a team. Mildred Koss,
        shortly after arriving at the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, was
        handed the task of having the UNIVAC automatically edit its data for
        printing. The result was Koss’s “editing generator,” a sophisticated
        piece of code that created margins, titles, headings, and page numbers
        on the fly and represented the first attempt to use a computer for word
        processing. Harry Kahrimanian, just out of college, got an even more
        daunting assignment: he was asked to create a program that could
        automatically solve differential equations. Kahrimanian’s differentiator
        was a watershed in applied mathematics. The user had merely to enter the
        equation and indicate the number of n derivatives; the computer did the
        rest. Kahrimanian’s achievement was even more impressive in light of
        Hopper’s own long and arduous experience working alongside the famed
        mathematician John von Neumann to solve differential equations on the
        Harvard Mark I. Had Kahrimanian’s differentiator been available to von
        Neumann and Hopper, they could have solved the Manhattan Project’s
        implosion problem in days instead of months.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        To understand Kahrimanian's contribution to trees, it's important to
        first understand Three-address codes (TAC), which is an intermediate
        representation of a program that uses at most three operands to
        represent an operation. TAC can be represented as a tree-like structure
        where the nodes represent the operands and operators, and the edges
        represent the flow of data between them. For instance,
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/history-trees/tac-example.png" />
        <figcaption>Figure 6: An example of a Three-address code.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        For Kahrimanian's differentiator system, he defined a symbolic language
        to express elementary functions and their derivatives using
        three-address code expressions like:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/history-trees/tac-table.png" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 7: Table describing the TAC for Kahrimanian's differentiator
          system.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        These expressions were then used to define a function in three-address
        code, which in turn could be represented as a tree-like structure.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/history-trees/tac-expansion.png" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 8: An example from the paper that shows how a function can be
          defined in three-address code.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        However, it's worth noting that Kahrimanian did not use the term "tree"
        in his paper to describe these structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, Donald Knuth had the following to say about the explicit mention
        of trees in the early days of Computer Science:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Since then, tree structures in various guises have been studied
        independently by many people in connection with numerous computer
        applications, but the basic techniques for tree manipulation (not
        general List manipulation) have seldom appeared in print except in
        detailed description of particular algorithms. The first general survey
        was made in connection with a more general study of all data structures
        by K. E. Iverson and L. R. Johnson [IBM Corp. research reports RC-390,
        RC-603, 1961; see Iverson, A Programming Language (New York: Wiley,
        1962), Chapter 3]. See also G. Salton, CACM 5 (1962), 103–114.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        And that’s it, folks! I hope you enjoyed this little adventure I took
        you on today. We spend most of our lives trying to learn the what and
        the why of our fields, but it is nice to stop once in a while and ask
        ourselves: how did we achieve all of this, who was responsible for it,
        and what problems were they initially trying to solve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Make no mistake, I am sure that I have missed exploring many
        contributions. However, I encourage curious readers to further explore
        the various citations I’ve sprinkled throughout this blog. Who knows?
        You might find some treasures in the works of Borchardt, Listing,
        Jordan, and Borůvka.

	<summary>6. Create an affordable solution through image processing of number plates of vehicles for the detection, identification and monitoring of vehicles in different senarios such as residential societies, tolls, business complex, parking spaces etc.</summary>
	<p>
	<p>Description: Many residential society administrations, tolls, business complexes and parking spaces in India lack an automated system for car parking and vehicle monitoring. Most of the commercial and residential places face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises. This issue is not bounded to just parking, but also adds to the security concerns inside those establishments. Though there are solutions that exist in the market, the affordability comes into question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable solution that caters to the Indian markets</p>
	<p>Expectation: For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model / infrastructure of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a checkpost and the solution identifies as many features as it can regarding the situation of the vehicle. All Teams will be provided with an amount of video footage. The teams must build a fictitous database based on the vehicles appering in footage and demonstrate the problems that they are able to solve/automate in existing infrastucture. (For example, if a team is trying to solve problems of a residential complex, they might create a database of some of the vehicles appearing in the footage and list them as residents and others not registered in the database to be considered as visitors).</p>
	<p>Applicants will be provided video data through the following website link.</p>
	<p>http://mixorg.com/competitions/SIH-2020/registration Each team is supposed to download the data and annotate it according to the features they are going to build. Teams must come up with new features for monetization of their business model and must build machine learning models (for preliminary shortlisting and finals) and required mobile/web applications(for finals only) reflecting the same features . Teams are requested to share the annotations done by them on the video data and the pattern of annotation. Teams are requested to build the machine learning model and share a working code on github(privately with <span class="citation" data-cites="chetanbansiwal">@chetanbansiwal</span> or publically)</p>
	Teams will be judged on the following grounds in the same order as written for the next round : 1. Accuracy of the model in performing the expected task. 2. Speed of the model in performing the expected task. 3. The precision followed during annotation of data. 4. The relevance of annotations considering the problem the team is expecting to solve with it.

	<summary>8. Gamification for Health data collection</summary>
	<p>
	<p>Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this: 1. Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 2. The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance.</p>
	At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better. This app will also act as a source for insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these questions to get your health score/ heart age).

	<summary>9. Lab Report Digitization / OCR</summary>
	<p>
	Insurance companies regularly gets health check reports submitted by potential buyers of insurance. We need a way to digitize different kinds of printed lab reports / health check reports to discrete values of each parameter captured. Conversion to a standardized set of digitized value will help in automating lot of backend approval process. Ability to read and classify comments/observations for common parameters will be a big plus When a customer is uploading his health check report regularly, then also a trend chart can be plotted for key parameters. Few sample reports will be provided to the participating teams. Test will be based on that as well as unknown set of health check reports post completion.

	<summary>10. Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data</summary>
	<p>
	The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient’s Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016). The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources. Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.). Abstract Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body’s response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/

	<summary>18. Design of Energy Efficient Regenerative Hydraulic System for 100 Ton Excavator</summary>
	<p>
	An excavator is a construction vehicle used to excavate or move large objects. The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement. The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm &amp; bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick. The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360° unhindered and thus provides the left-and-right movement. Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM’s. When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available. A new regeneration scheme to recover these energies to reduce the power loss and energy /fuel saving. The total potential energy could be regenerated under the standard operating conditions in the proposed system should be more energy efficient at least 30~40% of existing system. Outcome expected: 1. Propose alternative Design for energy efficient Regenerative Hydraulic system for 100 ton Excavator. 2. Alternative concept and features should meet or exceed the hydraulic system efficiency of current hydraulic system. 3. Concept needs to be described with block diagram and working principle indicating regeneration of hydraulic energy to be described in hydraulic system line diagram. 4. The proposed energy regeneration system to be verified through simulation result which is done in AMESim / Simulink or any other software. 5. Need to explain the functional block model, methodology, Algorithm and flow chart used. 6. The proposed energy recovery system and control strategy should improve energy recovery efficiency and optimize working performance of the system. 7. Proposed regenerative hydraulic circuit to be simulated at various operating conditions.

	<p>Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Solution Expected:</p>
	<p>The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism. 1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system. 2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger.</p>
	<p>Tech recommendation:   The Conversational AI Playbook can be integrated with Webex Teams and help tourists in the following key areas like Travel Planner – The Chatbot must act as a virtual travel agent who is able to share the suggestions based on the users travel preferences. It should be capable to check the Hotel Room Availability Recommend the right package based on tourist profile. Keep tourist informed about the details of the journey like check ins, flight /Train status etc. Route complex queries to human agents in real time (Adventure Tourism)</p>
	<p>The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria:  1. Depth and research to understand Indian Tourism Industry (Domain Knowledge) 2.

	<p>
	<p>The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India and is designed to improve the nutritional standing of school-age children nationwide. The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in Government schools. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme.</p>
	<p>Solution Expected: As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging. Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve: Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing &amp; Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the scalability factor of the system.</p>
	<p>The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria:</p>

	<summary>33. Renewable Energy forecasting, for an integrated smart grid</summary>
	<p>
	<p>BACKGROUND: Advances in technology have enabled large-scale harnessing of sources of renewable energy (solar, wind etc.). Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables real-time demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed. Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management. For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast. Literature proposes various learning-based forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demand-supply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.</p></li>
	</ol>
	<p>PROBLEM STATEMENT: 1. Simulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers. 2. For the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forums-develop energy generation forecasting models. 3. For the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forums-develop energy demand forecasting models. 4. Develop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller. 5. Integrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1. 6. Prototype the following use case with developed models: An Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time. The manager will require a dashboard that provides a micro- and macroscopic spatio-temporal trend of: (a) consumer demand maps; (b) prosumer supply; (c) solar/wind energy generated; (d) conventional energy generated; (e) outages; (f) accuracies of forecasting models for energy demand and energy generated (conventional and renewable); (g) scheduling decision report.</p>
	<p>OUTCOME EXPECTED: 1. A microgrid simulation model (with scheduling strategy integrated at controller). 2. Forecasting models to predict demand, renewable energy generated. (possibly Statistical/Machine Learning models). 3. Scheduling strategy/algorithm to manage resources to meet demands. (optimization algorithm based on forecasting model of demand and generation). 4. A web-application of the dashboard with appropriate visualizations and reports.</p>

	<summary>35. Data Mining Robot using AI / ML</summary>
	<p>
	<p>Back Ground: A corporate action is an event initiated by a public company that will bring an actual change to the securities—equity or debt—issued by the company. Corporate actions are typically agreed upon by a company’s board of directors and authorized by the shareholders. Examples of corporate actions include stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs. Corporate action instantly impacts security valuation and hence its timely and accurate information is very critical to financial institutes and investors. Information on current, upcoming, and historical corporate action can be purchased from various data vendors like Bloomberg, ICE Data Service, Refinitiv, MarketMap, etc. which could be expensive. Alternatively, data could be freely retrieved from public webpages and company portal. Challenge with free data approach is its accuracy, reliability and completeness</p>
	<p>Problem Statement: Goal of corporate action (CA) robot is to retrieve accurate, and complete information on historical, current, and future expected corporate action in timely manner from free sources. Required features: 1. Capability of crawling public web pages to retrieve information related to historical, current, and future expected corporate action. Data could potentially be available directly on webpage or in form of downloadable file (.pdf, .docx) 2. Ability of process information available in free text format like pdf, and MS word document 3. Intelligently identify context in which data is available, like is it listed as example, or is it a real announced corporate action. We should also be able to classify CA as approved or yet to be approved corporate action. 4. Extract important information from retrieved pages/files on corporate action like – Security Identifier type (ISIN, CUSIP, Ticker, etc.), Identifier Value, corporate action type, Ex. Date, record date, pay date, payment / ratio / other key information, other relevant corporate action details etc. Example: ISIN: INE239A01016 Company: Nestle India Type of CA: Interim dividend Amount: Rs. 55 Ex Date: 11/12/2019 Rec Date: 12/12/2019 Pay Date: 02/01/2020</p>
	<ol start="5" type="1">
	<li>Build accurate, and complete data from conflicting data retrieved from multiple sources. It should continuously learn about sources which could be trusted for specific information</li>
	<li>Ability to configure to look for CA on a set of securities, to all listed securities on specific exchange.</li>

	</ol>
	<p>Problem Statement:<br />
	For example, questions to assist development activities could be: What is the status of the release of Project X that was due this Friday? Why was Feature Y not fulfilled in the last release for Project X? How many test cases failed in the last release of Project X? Send me an email with the last release notes for Project X How to install Project X? How was Feature Z implemented? (Note: the robot would need to connect to all the applications, and dig out all the relevant information (description of features and linked commits / comments /guides) related the Feature Z Help me solve the class not found exception against “ClassName” (Note: this would mean running a query on stack overflow)</p>
	<p>Create an AI/ML based application to be hosted within a corporate/organization intranet with complete access to corporate/organization resources of JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket and Stack Overflow. The primary responsibility of this software robot (Intelligent Product Master - IPM) is to learn-mine-analyze-serve information about a product to optimize development and support processes in a product team.</p>
	<p>IPM’s input interfaces would be a mic and email to receive input from users. IPM’s output interfaces would be speaker and email to revert to users.</p>
	<p>Following are the two main use cases (but not limited to) 1. Anyone can ask/look up for any information to IPM. It responds with accurate answer by voice-to-text-conversion/email. Mining existing data (could use APIs of the information hosting applications). Co-relating multiple information, analyzes and respond text-to-voice/email. 2. Take the Speaker in a meeting (example: scrum ceremonies/meetings). It records the meeting MOM in detail in its own data-reservoir (database). The scrum master can also instruct IPM to do multiple activity during the meeting. Say: Create a jira task, pull out the last updated jira task. Send me the last email from XYZ to me etc.</p>
	To implement this, you can use a computer/speak/mail server and client, Voice-text-voice converter, text to jira / confluence / bitbucket / Stack Overflow APIs, AI to Analyze data to get accurate information, ML to learn when taken in a meeting. The key challenges in the problem would be to architect an information store that is optimally designed to answer queries, and accurately answer questions posed to it. For voice to text, and text to voice, you may use standard (free) libraries/services available in the market.

	<p>
	Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance.

	<summary>42. Rating an Airport Mapping Database</summary>
	<p>
	An Airport Mapping Database (AMDB) is a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of an airport describing the spatial layout of the aerodrome in terms of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, and parking stands) with geometry described as points, lines or polygons and with attributes (e.g. Surface type). AMDB is intended primarily to improve the user’s situational awareness and/or to supplement surface navigation, thereby increasing safety margins and operational efficiency. AMDB represents a collection of aerodrome information that is organized and arranged for ease of electronic storage and retrieval in systems that support aerodrome surface movements, training, charting, and planning. Project intents to Create Aerodrome Maps and Charts using feature extraction from Satellite Imagery and blending that with existing Aerodrome Maps and provide an interactive 2D map containing a spatial layout of the aerodrome in terms of features (e.g. runways, taxiways, parking stands) with geometry described as points, lines or polygons, and with attributes (e.g. surface type). The aerodrome map, charts and data is available in Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP India) uploaded on website https://aim-india.aai.aero/eaip-v2-01-2019/index-en-GB.html

	<p>
	<p>Whenever a passenger enters into an airport, their credentials are checked at check in Kiosks, Entry Gates, SHA, Immigration &amp; customs and boarding gates to validate their journey. Usually a passenger is instructed to come two hrs before for a domestic travel and four hours before an international travel. This instruction is given to passengers as their validation process might take more time than usual due to long passenger queues at each check point. The time taken by passenger to stand in a queue at a particular touch point and gets its credentials validated is called dwell time of that touch point. Hence, a mobile application based dwell time data collection and analysis at touch points of airports including check-in counters/Entry Gates/SHA/Immigration and customs/boarding gates using IOT. The Automated system needs to prompt necessary alert messages as per escalation matrix for dynamic allocation of manpower and facilities for a particular check point.</p>

	<p>
	Preoperative planning is a phase before actual surgery procedure in which the surgeon can take all the time needed to define the surgical problem, to identify fully all the anatomical and technical aspects of the procedure, and then carefully plan the solution. In order to facilitate this, the patient is assumed to be located in a coordinate system refered to as the ‘Patient Coordinate System’(PCS), whereas the surgeon has access to pre-operative medical scans(like CT/MRI etc.) of the subject in the coordinate system refered to as the ‘Image Coordinate System’(ICS). Any procedure planned in medical scans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping. The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration) between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of the surgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use of special markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICS mapping. Apart from establishing correspondances between the appearance of fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas and accurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducials or utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. The goal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm for detection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, the participants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on the skull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center of these fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system. Accruacy of their algorithm will be tested on the corresponding ground-truth values and generalization will be evaluated based on unseen test data.

	<p>
	In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualized MANET protocol shall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node in searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zones such as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in the area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed to modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol. The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establishment and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be in order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devices shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used. An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.

	<p>
	“Uttarakhand is primarily an agricultural state. The contribution of agriculture to the states domestic product is about 22.4 percent and the population dependent on agriculture for their livelihood is about 75 -85 percent. For instance, As per Uttarakhand state planning Commission, 2007, the productivity of wheat in the hills is 13.2 quintals/hectare and rice is 12.36 quintals/hectare. Thus, agricultural opportunities are developing rapidly in the state. Especially, in sector of organic agriculture, Uttarakhand Is highly accessible because of largely rain-fed agriculture and very low use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the produce grown by farmer in the area are not only rich in nutrients but also have high medicinal value and provides an opportunity to develop and farmer friendly environment of organic farming that provide better value in the market to Small and Marginal Land holder. The various project of Department of rural development and agriculture are continuously in the process of enhancing farmer and self-help groups (SHGs) livelihoods by adding value in their produce and providing favourable markets. Provide technology based interventions like Techniques of Value addition to agriculture produce, Packaging, Logistic movement, Farmer Branding and marketing avenues. This platform should enable direct movement of farmer to the consumer and reduce the intermediates who take away a lion’s share of commission.”

That means there will not be a previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system should immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas, the system should learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person.

	Goa is a major tourist destination which pulls thousands of tourists every year. Goa is known for its beautiful beaches and hospitality. There are a number of monuments and landmarks depicting the cultural, history and development of Goa. Due to high inflow of domestic as well as international tourists, the manpower required to guide the tourist on these landmark is not sufficient and sometimes lack in the information that need to be given and highlighted to the tourist. Hence we propose the problem of developing a mobile application which renders information about the monument or landmark just by taking their live pictures as inputs. In other word, the application should allow the user to click a photograph and based on the picture it should display information about the monument/landmark. The application should also notify the user about such monuments/landmarks in the vicinity. The app should also allow the user to give their inputs about the object and also add to knowledge creation about the monuments/landmark. The app should also be able to keep statics about the number of users referring to the monument/landmark along with details of the users.

Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming.</p></li>

	<p>In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below: a. Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). b. Uploading research, discovery of and access to information: It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise.</p>
	<p>A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool.</p>
	<ol start="3" type="a">
	<li>Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.

Information regarding area under various crops is generally available at an aggregate level e.g. district wise cultivated area under individual crops. Non-availability ofactual crop maps preventsspatial visualisation of water utilisation and therefore proper water accounting. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad generates yearly Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps at a finer resolution of 56m containing land use classes of crop season and number of crops (single/multiple crop). Crowdsourced information from farmers, agricultural extension service providers, local administration and local population may be used for generation of crop type maps for a particular irrigation season which in turn may be used for preparation of water accounts at various spatial scales rangingfrom command of a major to minor irrigation project. Water Accounting at various spatial and temporal scales in commands of irrigation projects will help in informed decision making during the ensuing crop season and leads to optimal utilisation of irrigation water.

	<p>
	Ghats are the series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf. Ghats are associated with legends or mythologies.  Ghats &amp; crematoria are considered one of the auspicious locations for this ritual. In hindu traditions, cremation is one of the rites of passage. A riverfront is a region along a river; often in larger cities that border a river, the riverfront will be lined with marinas, docks, parks, trees, or minor attractions. Today many riverfronts are a staple of modernism and city beautification. A citizen centric mobile app can be develop to provide information &amp; awareness about ghats, crematoria &amp; riverfront along Ganga river and its tributaries.

	<p>
	At present efforts are made to revise and upgrade the curriculum by the AICTE to train the students to cater to industrial needs. But there are several factors that prevents the students to reach their zenith and harness their skills as below: 1. Socio-economic background of the student. 2. Peer influence 3. Addiction to cell phones and social media. 4. parents pressure to join a course in which the student is not interested. 5. lack of strong foundation in the fundamentals. 6. General prevalence of Learning Disability. The current metrics of CGPA, certificates are not enough to accurately assess the capability of a student. many students are sacked from the company after one or two years because they are not happy with the performance. Exact Problem: Every individual has an inherent ability /talent. if only he/she gets a job suiting the skill set the goal of AICTE will be achieved. Higher productivity will be there and youth power has a major role to play in a Nation’s growth . Economy will improve. The proposed software should identify the skill set and assess the capacity of a student. It should recommend the suitable candidates against a requirement from the industry.

	<p>
	To develop a software tool (may be an app/plug-in) that archives the highlighted text from different sources and enable the user to retrieve according to his requirement wherever and whenever required from centralized storage. Description: Now a days the flow of information have been exponentially increased, and the information flow from a variety of sources. When a reader needs to highlight the textual information and use it as and when it is required at later point in time, there exists no tool for him. It becomes even more complex when the source of information is from across multiple platforms, gadgets and applications. Therefore, Bibliophile Companion is proposed to address the problem. The important challenge in this problem is, the information source may be of any type (e.g. .pdf, .doc, .html, etc) and the source of information may be from any environment. To have a centralized access of stored information, cloud infrastructure based solution is to be provided.

APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.</summary>
	<p>
	<p>Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) is a statutory organization entrusted to implement Environmental Laws and control pollution in the state of Andhra Pradesh through regulations.</p>
	<p>APPCB is presently using cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.</p>
	<p>As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring.</p>
	<p>APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.</p>
	<p>Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.</p>
	<p>Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.</p>
	<p>Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of Non-Attainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.</p>
	<p>Current System using in detailed: Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board uses cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industry categories existing in the state to be adequately monitored to check pollution in the long run.</p>
	<p>Significant indicators taken into consideration under CEMS are the emission and effluent quality standard limits as prescribed by the Board based on the industry type, category, local conditions and the characteristics of the emission and effluents by the industry.</p>
	APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.

There is a serious need of detailed research in the development of regional or national flood damage functions for pre-disaster flood damage estimation property. Risk assessment is important in making decisions, policies and managing floods. The objective of this study was to review and synthesize concepts and techniques of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment with reference to the Uttarakhad. Using geo spatial technology to model and predict the magnitude of flood risk areas, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis techniques are used for this study the flooding causative factors such as rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, drainage network and density. This study aims at providing expertise for preparing flood mapping and estimating flood risks in growing urban areas.GIS and remote sensing play an important role in flood hazard, vulnerability and in risk assessment and useful for delineation of flood zones, preparation of flood hazard and risk maps The main advantage of using GIS for flood analyses is that it not only generates a visualization of flooding, but also creates potential to further analyze these events to estimate probable damage due to floods. Compared to traditional mapping, GIS enables the comparisons across spatial units; comparison across different themes by category of hazards and disasters; merging of qualitative with qualitative assessment and spatial database, based on which logical and/or numerical operations can be dynamically performed. These are grounds for concluding that GIS has an important function to play in natural hazards analyses because natural hazards are multi-dimensional phenomena, which have a spatial component.

	The maintenance of rural and urban roads is becoming an increasing challenge as a result of the rapid growth of the network. A large amount of money is going to waste due to irregularity and improper approach. Sound asset management principles need to be introduced as an integral part of road policies and maintenance program. Comprehensive maintenance planning with schedule,institutional reforms, linkage with initial construction, maintenance backlog, utilization of fund, regular on site inspections, training to the workforce, human attitude, existing practices and knowledge of different road patterns are the major challenges in record-keeping. The maintenance and record keeping of maintenance is the key issues in the government department after the liability period over of new construction. A comprehensive system will help for planning of maintenance schedule, frame work, methodology. Also a prediction can be made for the timely maintenance fund requirements. Effective techniques can be decided for the problems. Quality of initial construction work can be achieved. It is more important to say that wastage of public fund can be reduced from the repetitive approach. Mostly, Public infrastructure is developed by the government department. It is obvious that various government bodies like municipalities, nagarpalika, panchayat and road and building department of state and central government etc. will be the potential users. Also private residential and commercial communities may use it for the maintenance records and fund estimation. A comprehensive maintenance record-keeping system will be the ready tool, which serve different aspects of complete qualitative maintenance such as, data base of complete any type of inspection on-site, recording defects including capture of images and location data to aid in repair, repair methodology applied, cost of maintenance, effective area of work, frequency of maintenance including during liability period of new constructions and fund planning for the future. It will be fruitful for the executors for social and economic development of users. Effective maintenance record keeping system will create social and economic impacts of rural roads users. It will serves ready record for long term budget planning as huge investment incurred in road infrastructure development. Some qualitative outputs such as, maintained roads provide access to where people live and important facilities such as markets, schools and health services. Good access provides the opportunity for improving livelihoods and increased employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the alleviation of poverty. Although it may be argued that the link between rural roads and poverty alleviation is mostly indirect, experience clearly shows that areas with poor road access are generally more disadvantaged than areas that are better served. The web application will contain an effective dashboard (visualization like a BI tool) which will provide different kinds of analysis , in order to take quick actions and to avoid spending excessive time in analysing this information. The application will be an effective tool as it will help save time and provide valuable information at a go to thus avoid wastage of public resource.

As network is very challenging throughout the state of Sikkim. Software should be design such a way that data can be entry offline and later on put into the web when network is available. Design a desktop based application that records a variety of data like attendance or students as well as teachers, marks of students, and other statutory data as required by education department. Most important aspect of this application is sync only when network is available. It should additionally provide facility to upload file separately once in a month.

	<summary>242. Online STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) Software or web portal.</summary>
	<p>
	Education Department Govt of Sikkim, every year conduct STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) exam for all categories of teachers Primary Teacher, Graduate Teacher and Post Graduate Teacher before the recruitment exam. All the eligible candidates will apply for STET, so the applicants will be almost 5000. Checking all the documents, verifying them and issuing admit cards to individual candidate manually is a difficult job, which we are carrying for many years. During this span of time we made human error and had to repeat the processes. What we want : To make the STET exam error free and quick solution, we are in need of online software or window where candidates can login, register, fill the form and submit. Software should keep bio data of the candidate, print admits cards and later we can display online result of STET as well. During all the process automatic SMS and Email facilities should be included. Mobile app will be more convenient along with software. Challenges Network connectivity is not uniform all throughout the state of Sikkim so software should be develop in such a way that it can run with less network ,that is it can open only that window which candidate wants. Design a application that integrates with some reliable system like DigiLocker for verification of documents, or accept documents signed by DigiLocker eSign for document verification. Reduce manual intervention wherever possible, manual verification should be done only when final offer letter is to be issued.

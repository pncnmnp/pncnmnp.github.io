      <h2>Stumbling upon a gem</h2>
      <p>
        I've been a student at NC State for just under two years now, and one of
        the most fascinating aspects of it is Hillsborough Street. Surrounding
        the main campus, this lively and cheerful street is home to some great
        food and boasts the evergreen Bell tower at one end. However, its
        lesser-known gem is a bookstore called <i>the Reader's Corner</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's truly fascinating about this spot is that you can buy some
        incredible books at an incredibly low price. Outside the store, there
        are shelves filled with used books, and the remarkable thing about these
        shelves is that any book on the left side of the store costs 25 cents,
        and on the right, it costs 10 cents. And if that's not enough, they
        update these shelves periodically with a variety of books. The store's
        owner, Irv Coats,
        <a
          href="https://www.wral.com/raleigh-bookstore-owner-focuses-on-everything-except-the-profits/19742188/
        "
          >has been running it since 1980</a
        >
        and donates all the proceeds from the outdoor book sales to NPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        The store itself is absolutely fascinating as well. You can scan
        hundreds of comics, most of which are priced at a dollar. They also have
        an extensive collection of science fiction and detective stories, as
        well as fun items like posters, which usually cost around $2.
      </p>
      <p>
        This month, when I visited the store, their poster collection caught my
        eye, and I decided to browse through their collection in the hope of
        finding inspiration for my next blog post. That's when I came across the
        following poster:
      </p>

          My poster appears to be an advertisement for an Addressograph.

      <p>
        Truth be told, this was the first time I heard of an
        <b>Addressograph</b>. So what does it do? What was the motivation behind
        its creation? And how does it work?
        <i> Let's take a dive into an Addressograph.</i>
      </p>
      <h2>What was the motivation behind its creation?</h2>
      <p>
        In 1892, <i>Joseph Smith Duncan</i> created the Addressograph, which is
        an <i>addressing machine</i> at its core. That is,
      </p>
      <blockquote

      "
      >
        a business machine that automatically imprints names, addresses, or
        other information on successive envelopes or forms.
      </blockquote>

          >.

      </figure>
      <p>
        At a first glance, automatically imprinting addresses may seem like a
        small feat, even for the 1890s. In fact, in the early 2010s I recall
        sending handwritten letters to my grandfather and he'd reply to me with
        letters bearing his stamped address. He'd invested in a rubber stamp
        with an ink pad for this purpose. Eventually, he switched to using
        address stickers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that a rubber stamp would have sufficed during the 1890s,
        <i> why create a mechanical device like this? </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, during a 1918 interview for the
        <a
          href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nS7PAAAAMAAJ
        "
        >
          Manufacturing and Wholesale Industries of Chicago (Volume 2)</a
        >, J.S. Duncan shared his thoughts on experimenting with rubber stamps:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        With as little prospect of getting another position as there was in
        those days (<u
          >Duncan here is referring to the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893
            "
            >Panic of 1893</a
          ></u
        >), I began to wonder how I might use my small amount of capital in
        making a living. The addressing machine idea had been clinging to me
        persistently, and as I had a good deal of mechanical experience in my
        work at the mill, I decided to experiment with the hope of producing a
        device which could be marketed.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        My first experiment was pretty crude. I glued the rubber parts of a
        number of hand stamps onto a big wooden drum. This drum was then
        revolved from one address to another to do the printing. The work was
        readable, and there was no chance to make mistakes in the addresses. But
        the drum only held a few names. How was it to take care of even a small
        mailing list such as we had at the bank? Clearly the plan was a failure,
        because it was not practical.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The motivation was to develop a more scalable version of the rubber
        stamp approach. It's worth mentioning that addressing machines existed
        even before the 1890s, but Addressograph emerged as one of the major
        victors of the 19th century. The Early Office Museum
        <a
          href="https://www.officemuseum.com/mail_machines.htm
        "
        >
          provides a more in-depth history of addressing machines</a
        >. I also found
        <b>Wright and Peck and H. Moeser's addressing machine</b> from the 1860s
        particularly interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fascinatingly,
        <a
          href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8175
        "
          >Moeser's patent</a
        >
        is concise and spells out how it operates:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The machine consists of levers, a slide, and a set of types, combined in
        such a manner that it is possible to print with it any number of names
        on papers or letters. Thus to print the names of subscribers on
        newspapers the following plan is pursued. The names (of persons or
        places) to be printed are set up in type in a column and secured in a
        form which moves by means of a slide beneath a stamp in such a manner
        that every Word in the column, one after another, is exposed to the
        action of the stamp, and so that paper after paper brought between the
        stamp and the types gets the proper impression.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Before the operation of the machine is to commence the whole set of
        names in the form is inked at once and put on the slide so that the
        first name in the column is right under the slit of the plate, and the
        impression is effected then by holding the paper on which the name is to
        be printed under the stamp and by pressing the main lever down. By
        raising the lever again the slide moves by the action of the spring-pawl
        so much that the second name of the column gets beneath the stamp, and
        if then another paper is brought under the stamp the second name will be
        printed on it by pressing the main lever down, and so forth, till the
        whole number of names is printed on the respective papers.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So, let's jump back to Addressograph.
        <i> Did J.S. Duncan not have knowledge of Moeser's work? </i> It seems
        that he didn't. In that same interview in 1918, Duncan stated the
        following:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Back in 1892 I was in charge of the books of a large milling concern in
        Sioux City, Iowa. Among other duties I had to see that a number of flour
        price lists and bids for grain were sent out each day to a list of
        people with whom he regularly did business. This addressing was a
        tedious job. It used to keep one of the young men in the office busy
        most of the time. Every now and then one of these bids would go astray
        through a mistake in the address, with the result that other milling
        companies would get the business. In a year's time these losses amounted
        to a good deal of money.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        As I was a stockholder and director in the company, although the amount
        of stock I held in those days was necessarily small, I was much annoyed
        by this loss of business. I felt that there ought to be some way of
        addressing our cards mechanically, a way that would prevent mistakes and
        that would save most of the time and effort then wasted by the clerks in
        writing, over and over again, the same names and addresses.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        So I looked for an addressing machine. I searched all the trade papers,
        and wrote to several office supply houses in Chicago, but to no avail.
        There was no such thing as a commercial addressing machine on the
        market; so I let the matter drop for the time being.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        At this point, a natural question to ask would be,
        <i>how does it work</i>? And how is it different from Moeser's machine,
        as well as other addressing machines that came before it?
      </p>

      <h2>The How</h2>
      <p>
        The original Addressograph, created by J.S. Duncan had a simple yet
        remarkably ingenious start. In the 1918 interview, Duncan described how
        it worked:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        One day it occurred to me that the difficulty might be done away with by
        setting up the addresses in individual rubber type, and linking them in
        detachable chains of carriable length. I made a model along these lines
        and showed it to several of my business friends. Most of them thought
        the idea very clever, but all were skeptical as to its practicability;
        in fact, several of them laughed at the thing, and told me I was foolish
        to waste time in trying to commercialize a device of that kind.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        But no doubting or ridicule could disturb my conviction. Encouraged by a
        very good friend, I came to Chicago in the latter part of '93 and rented
        a small room on Dearborn street where I proposed to begin the
        manufacture of the Addressograph.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        My invention relates to improvements in addressing-machines in which a
        chain of detachable type-plates is suspended over a rotating drum and a
        plunger or stamper capable of being driven downward upon the top of the
        drum carries a platen into contact at each movement of the machine with
        one of the type-plates, which are inked from a suitable inking device;
        and the objects of my improvement are to provide,
        <ul>
          <li>
            first, a type-belt easily removable and capable of being compactly
            stored away when not in use;
          </li>
          <li>
            second, an inking device having a direct bearing on the type,
            without rolling or sliding, and in which the ink-pad is normally
            closed from air and dust;
          </li>
          <li>
            third, a simple and accurate means of rotating the type-belt so as
            to bring the name-plates successively under the platen;
          </li>
          <li>
            fourth, to dispense with all pulleys for the type-belt, suspending
            it from a single drum;
          </li>
          <li>
            fifth, to provide a detachable link which will retain the
            printing-surface and yet allow it to be easily removed, and in which
            any link can be easily removed from the chain, and,
          </li>
          <li>
            sixth, to produce a small compact addressing-machine capable of
            being easily clamped to the edge of a desk or table.

          From Duncan's 1896 patent for Addressograph. Duncan mentions that the
          figure is "a side elevation of the entire machine, except that the
          endless type-belt is broken away, showing that portion of it which
          passes over the drum and its lower end." The figure 3 seems to be
          involved in rotating the type-belt when the plunger is pressed down,
          bringing new name-plates under the platen for printing. A hinged lever
          with a curved beak is used, where the beak is firmly wedged between
          two teeth on the drum.

      <p>
        As Duncan found success after selling his initial machines, he worked on
        various iterations to improve his design. In the same interview, he
        said:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Enthusiastic over our success in selling these first machines, I had a
        hundred more built. These were arranged so that a foot lever could be
        attached, thereby leaving both the operator's hands free for feeding the
        envelopes. It was a much needed improvement, and served greatly to speed
        up the work of the machine.
      </blockquote>

          >This led to the eventual creation of the Addressograph Company in
          1893.</i
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Finally, what is this poster about?</h2>

      <p>
        At the bottom of the poster,
        <b> Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio </b> is boldly
        mentioned. So, it's worth tracing back steps from this part. Firstly,
        how did this corporation come into being? Well, when J.S. Duncan decided
        to bring the Addressograph into production in the 1890s, he partnered
        with John B. Hall, a salesman who investigated the prospective market
        and helped demonstrate the product to business magnates. According to
        the
        <a
          href="https://www.madeinchicagomuseum.com/single-post/addressograph-co/
        "
          >Addressograph article on Made in Chicago museum</a
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        By the early 1920s, John Hall had passed away, and Duncan was in
        semi-retirement, spending a lot of his time in Los Angeles with his wife
        Adelaide. Finally, in 1924, he elected to step away for good, with half
        the interest in Addressograph staying with the Hall family, and the
        other half acquired by another Chicago businessman, Frank H. Woods of
        Lincoln Telephone & Telegraph.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        Woods installed Joseph Egerton Rodgers as the new company president, and
        by 1930, after some legal battles with the Hall family, the new
        ownership struck a deal to merge the Addressograph International Corp.
        with one of its chief rivals, the American Multigraph Co. of Cleveland,
        Ohio. The new organization, known as the Addressograph-Multigraph
        Corporation, ultimately centralized its operations in Cleveland.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Apparently,
        <a
          href="https://case.edu/ech/articles/a/am-international-inc
        "
          >the merger was completed in 1932</a
        >, and around 1933, the 152-page book titled “Business Short Cuts,”
        containing Addressograph methods and machines (<i
          >as mentioned in the bottom-left part of the poster</i
        >), was published. Hence, my guess would be that
        <b>this poster is from the early 1930s</b>. The quality of the poster is
        remarkably impressive for something that is nearly 90 years old!
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>So, what ultimately happened to this new corporation?</i> According
        to the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, the company experienced steady
        growth after World War II and by 1967, it had accumulated $400 million
        in sales from its parent and 27 subsidiaries. However, the emergence of
        Xerox in the 1970s had a major impact on their success. Despite making
        numerous changes and significant cuts to improve efficiency, the company
        ultimately closed its doors in 1982 and filed for bankruptcy under
        Chapter 11.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        And that's it folks! I hope you enjoyed this dive down a rather obscure
        part of history. I'll continue making occasional trips to the Reader's
        Corner in search of hidden treasures like these.

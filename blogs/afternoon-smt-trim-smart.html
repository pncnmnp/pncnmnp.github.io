          It was a brand new program. There were no textbooks. So Ivan

          guys were. Ivan Sutherland came in, he was wearing flip flops, and I
          thought it was one of the hippie graduate students that was teaching
          the course. I didn't know. </i

          program they had for making pictures with spheres and elliptical

          Well, screw using that existing package,--- I wanted to write my own

          Vaseline on the back of your hand, which I didn't know at the time.
          So, my hand got stuck in the mold. Stuck a knife down in there to cut
          my hand out of that. And then went through this laborious process of
          digitizing, and then I wrote a program to animate it, and then that
          led to getting my first paper published in the ACM in Boston--- in
          1972, I think is when it was. </i

        After using my 2015 13-inch MacBook Air for quite a few years, I finally
        took the plunge and got myself a new laptop. To call my older boyo’s
        specs a bit dated would be an understatement. The now-veteran ran on a
        processor from Intel's Broadwell series — a dual-core i5-5250U with a
        base clock speed of 1.6 GHz, which could turbo boost up to 2.7 GHz.
        Thanks to hyper-threading, each physical core could handle two threads
        simultaneously, effectively acting as four logical CPUs. It had two
        memory slots, each containing a 4 GB RAM module. This was a 1600 MHz
        DDR3 manufactured by Hynix. However, the icing on the cake was its 256
        GB PCIe-based SSD, a significant upgrade over the previous generation’s
        SATA-based SSDs. This one had a four-lane PCIe connection with a
        transfer speed of 5 GT/s per lane — so likely PCIe 2.0!

          Figure 1: My old boyo! There’s a rather fun story about the green
          star. Back in my master's days, I used to do research in NC State's
          Theory Lab. One day, I was doing some work when, all of a sudden, my
          labmate Oliver came by and stuck this green star sticker on my laptop.
          All he said was, "Never take it off!" It is still here, Oliver!

        Now, some of you might be wondering —
        <i>how can one survive with a 256 GB SSD for 5+ years?</i> The answer
        is: <i>on a wing and a prayer</i>. On a serious note, the low storage
        never bothered me one iota. As of yesterday, I still had around 86 GB
        available. Most of my space is taken up by a trifecta of code,
        documents, and images anyway. As the saying goes,
        <a

      <p>
        Tangentially, if you want to find this hardware information on macOS,
        you can simply use <code>system_profiler -detailLevel basic</code> along
        with some good ol’ <code>grep -A 20</code> commands.

        When purchasing my new laptop, I was kind of tempted to go the “Windows
        on ARM” route with their new Surface lineup, which has excited me a
        great deal last year. However, after some careful deliberation, I
        decided to give it two more years — hoping for a little more stable x86
        translation experience. For now, I have somewhat settled on a 2023
        MacBook Pro loaded up with their M2 Pro chip. This new recruit brings
        with it 16 GB of LPDDR5 RAM from Micron and, this time around, a
        whopping 1 TB PCIe-based NVMe SSD soldered to the motherboard.

      <h2>SMT</h2>

      <p>
        Now, I really would have preferred removable SSDs, but that train's been
        long gone. The manufacturer incentive seems too strong of a pull for
        them to budge. Integrated SSDs allow for a more compact and lighter form
        factor, simplify assembly, and lower manufacturing costs. As I
        understand it, they achieve this using
        <b>surface-mount technology</b> (SMT).

        >
        in 2001 describing SMT from a broader perspective:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Since the 1980s there has been a significant growth in the use of
          surface mount technology for electronics assembly. The advantages of
          surface mount include reduced board size through denser circuitry,
          lower product weight through device miniaturization, simplified
          circuit board fabrication with the absence of holes, and faster
          circuitry because package leads and long signal traces are eliminated.
          Also, large-volume, surface mount assembly processes can produce
          high-quality consumer and military electronics in a cost-effective
          manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the term implies, surface mount technology uses electronic devices
          that are soldered only to the surface of the circuit board. Packages
          may have leads along two or all four sides of their periphery. Lead
          configurations include the gull-wing lead, J-lead, and S-lead
          geometries. Some packages have no leads at all. So-called leadless
          discrete devices include discrete resistors, capacitors, and
          inductors. The solder connection is made to a conductive surface or
          termination made from a fired-on metal film (typically silver-based
          with a nickel or copper barrier layer). Silicon chips are mounted in
          larger, leadless packages termed leadless ceramic chip carriers (or
          LCCCs). The solder connection is made to a conductive surface referred
          to as the castellation, which is also comprised of a fired-on metal
          coating (typically gold).
        </p>

        >
        from Steve Burke at GamersNexus from about a decade ago, explaining how
        RAM and SSDs are made at Kingston’s SMT lines. Today, many surface-mount
        packaging technologies are used to attach these ICs to circuit boards.
      </p>

      <p>
        From what I can tell, the packaging technology used for SSD components
        is

          >Ball Grid Array (BGA)</a
        >. In BGA, components are mounted onto the SSD using an array of solder
        balls. Because these tiny solder balls are arranged in a grid pattern
        instead of just along the edges, they allow for a large number of I/O
        connections in a small space — providing high density. This naturally
        helps more data transfer simultaneously in a small form factor. Also,
        because the solder balls are in direct contact with the circuit board,
        heat generated by the chip is transferred away efficiently — providing
        high heat conduction. Again, this can help extend the lifespan of SSDs,

        found that the hotter your SSD runs, the quicker it wears out the flash
        memory inside of the drive. So while an SSD can technically operate at
        the higher ranges advertised by manufacturers, you’re going to get
        better data integrity and more life out of your SSD if you keep it cool.

          >The Wikipedia page</a
        >
        also discusses how BGAs seem to provide low-inductance leads, which is
        quite advantageous.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance">Inductance</a> is "<i
          >the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the
          electric current flowing through it</i
        >". Therefore, low-inductance leads allow electrical conductors (solder
        balls in BGA) to have minimal resistance to fast-changing currents. From
        an SSD point of view, this can allow quicker and more stable data
        transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I am sure we can agree, these factors are quite attractive for
        manufacturing mass-produced consumer electronics, which is why we seem
        to have boarded the "<i>bye-bye removable SSDs</i>" train! Whoa, what a
        tangent this was!

      <h2>TRIM</h2>

      <p>
        Circling back to my new laptop, when I was comparing its specs with my
        older machine, I noticed something fun — both had the following
        statement in their SSD configs: "<i>TRIM Support: Yes</i>". Now, I was
        not quite sure what <b>TRIM</b> meant, so I started digging into it, and
        boy, was it fascinating! Two of the most concise insights I found were

        You see, there are standard interfaces used for connecting HDDs and SSDs
        to computers. For instance, there is SATA (Serial ATA), SCSI, and NVMe
        over PCIe. The ATA implementation standard consists of an
        <a

        >
          ATA/ATAPI Command Set
        </a>
        that specifies the collection of command sets a host system can use to
        access storage devices. One of these is the ATA TRIM command. Brendan
        Gregg succinctly describes this in his book:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        it informs the SSD that a region is no longer in use, allowing the SSD
        to more easily assemble its pool of free blocks, reducing write
        amplification. (For SCSI, this can be implemented using the UNMAP or
        WRITE SAME commands; for ATA, the DATA SET MANAGEMENT command. Linux
        support includes the discard mount option, and the fstrim(8) command.)
      </blockquote>

        Let us break this down by first understanding SSD internals at a glance.

      <blockquote>
        To increase storage density, flash manufactories package several flash
        chips together, a model called <b>package</b>. All chips in a package
        share the same 8/16-bit I/O bus of the package but have separate chip
        enable and ready/busy control signals. Each chip is composed of two or
        more <b>dies</b>. Each die has one internal ready/busy signal that is
        different from the external ready/busy signal of a chip. The internal
        ready/busy signal is invisible to user. It will only be used in advanced
        commands. Each die is composed of multiple <b>planes</b>. Each plane
        contains thousands of flash <b>blocks</b> and one or two data/cache
        registers used as an <b>I/O buffer</b>. A flash block typically consists
        of 64 or 128 pages, where a page is further divided into many 512B
        sub-pages. Each sub-page has a 16B spare space used to store a variety
        of information, such as error correction code (ECC), logical page number
        and sub-page state. The size of a page has been steadily increasing due
        to the technology development as well as the growing size of a single
        chip. While chip and die are not clearly distinguished and often
        confused with each other in many previous studies in the literature,
        chip enable and read/busy signals make them clearly distinct from each
        other. A chip is the basic functional unit that has its independent chip
        enable and read/busy signals. A die is a component of a chip, which only
        has an internal read/busy signal.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This dissection from 2011 remains largely true today. For instance, here
        is a
        <a
          href="https://www.ssd.group/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SZ1735_25_SSD_Spec_v1.1_for_General.pdf"
          >specification of Samsung’s SZ1735a Z-SSD</a

        >
          product brief</a
        >. While a page may contain sub-pages, modern SSD specs seem to refer
        only to the whole page size instead. For instance, we can infer
        SZ1735a’s page size by looking at the “Data I/O Speed” section, which
        describes a 4KB data size. Block sizes are not typically mentioned
        either, but if we consider a typical range of 128 to 512 pages, we are
        looking at blocks with sizes around 512KB (128 pages x 4KB) to 2048KB
        (512 pages x 4KB).

        So how is all of this related to the TRIM command? What you just
        witnessed was a <i>Pledge</i>. Now,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trim_(computing)#Background"
          >here is the <i>Turn</i></a
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        An SSD write operation can be done to a single page but, due to hardware
        limitations, erase commands always affect entire blocks; consequently,
        writing data to empty pages on an SSD is very fast, but slows down
        considerably once previously written pages need to be overwritten. Since
        an erase of the cells in the page is needed before it can be written to
        again, but only entire blocks can be erased, an overwrite will initiate
        a read-erase-modify-write cycle: the contents of the entire block are
        stored in cache, then the entire block is erased from the SSD, then the
        overwritten page(s) is written into the cached block, and only then can
        the entire updated block be written to the flash medium. This phenomenon
        is known as <b>write amplification</b>.

      <p>
        So what is this "<i>hardware limitation</i>" that Wikipedia is referring
        to?
        <a
          href="https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/collateral/white-paper/white-paper-sandisk-flash101-management.pdf"
          >Western Digital’s 2018 whitepaper on flash</a
        >
        perfectly describes this limitation:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The basic NAND flash cell is a floating gate transistor with the bit
        value determined by the amount of charge trapped in the floating gate.
        NAND flash uses tunnel injection for writing/programming and tunnel
        release for erasing the cell.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        In SLC (Single-Level Cell):
        <ul>
          <li>
            Writing (e.g., programming) to a cell causes the accumulation of
            negative charge in the floating gate, resulting in a “0” bit value
            for that cell.
          </li>
          <li>
            Erasing a cell removes the negative charge in the floating gate,
            resulting in a “1” bit value for that cell. To change the bit
            content of a cell from “0” to “1”, the cell must be erased. Due to
            the NAND architecture of sharing bit control lines and word control
            lines across multiple storage transistors, erasing a cell requires
            erasing the entire Erase Block, which contains that cell.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        What Western Digital is explaining in their whitepaper is that this
        design is geared toward simplicity and density, which, in turn, keeps
        costs down. While allowing for selective erasure of individual pages
        might be theoretically possible, it would likely require adding more
        complex circuitry. This would increase costs by potentially reducing the
        storage density of the chips and increasing the physical size of each
        die.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now for the <i>Prestige</i>. How would you do it —
        <i>mitigate write amplification?</i> A natural thought would be to hold
        off on performing an erasure. When data needs to be updated, start by
        writing the updated data to an empty page. Next, mark the old page
        containing outdated data as invalid. Finally, keep track of valid and
        invalid pages. When the SSD needs more space or when the system is idle,
        the block containing invalid pages can be erased in a garbage collection
        process. This avoids a costly read-erase-modify-write cycle.
      </p>

        <i>And that is how SSDs mitigate write amplification.</i> The tracking
        of valid and invalid pages is handled by the SSD’s controller using the
        <b>Flash Translation Layer</b> (FTL) component. The TRIM command, in
        turn, is sent by the OS to inform the SSD controller which blocks or
        pages of data are invalid and no longer needed by the OS. This helps the
        FTL update its mapping table and later perform a cleanup during the
        garbage collection process. Here is a

          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121005122335/http://download.intel.com/design/flash/nand/mainstream/Intel_SSD_Optimizer_White_Paper.pdf"
          >2009 whitepaper from Intel</a
        >
        summarizing this:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional hard disk drives, it is advantageous to tell an SSD
          when you delete files. At some point every 4KB page has been written
          to once, and you have to start overwriting old existing data. Unlike
          spinning media, Flash media can not simply overwrite existing data and
          must first perform a 512KB block erase. To overwrite existing data, an
          SSD requires a longer read-modify-write operation which is the basis
          for slowing write performance as the drive fills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, there was no ATA command that would physically erase
          user-deleted data from a storage device. The Intel® SSD Optimizer
          takes advantage of the new DATA SET MANAGEMENT command now available
          in the ATA8-ACS-2 specification. A feature of this new command is
          known as “Trim”, which allows the host to collect file system
          information from the OS and proactively send it to the drive. By
          knowing which files are no longer valid, the drive can better manage
          its operations.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

        examined in FlashDBA’s blog posts. I highly encourage you to check out
        his posts on understanding

      <h2>SMART</h2>

      <p>
        The rabbits might be wondering whether I am done with SSDs, and if so,
        can we now move on to greener pastures? Well, hoppity-hop... not just
        yet! You see, when I was exploring the SSD configs, another setting
        caught my attention — "<i>S.M.A.R.T. status: Verified</i>". So, I
        thought about doing a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX0n-rYxrfs"
          >"Mr. Beanish" dive</a
        >
        into SMART as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>SMART</b> stands for
        <i>Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology</i> and is a "<i
          >signaling method between sensors in the drive and the host
          computer</i
        >". It helps the host monitor the drives to assess their health and
        reliability. The <i>"Verified"</i> status above indicates that my SSD’s
        monitoring system has found everything to be hunky-dory. Samsung, in a
        <a
          href="https://download.semiconductor.samsung.com/resources/others/SSD_Application_Note_SMART_final.pdf"
          >2014 application note</a
        >, describes this in greater detail:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          S.M.A.R.T. monitors computer drives to detect and report on various
          reliability indicators. The technology aims to anticipate failures and
          warn users of impending drive failure, allowing the user to replace an
          ailing drive to avoid data loss and/or unexpected outages. Of course,
          SMART can only warn of predictable errors, which result from slow
          processes like mechanical wear and can be predicted by analyzing
          certain indicators (such mechanical problems accounted for 60% of HDD
          failures). Unpredictable failures, like a sudden mechanical failure
          resulting from an electrical surge, have no measurable variables to
          track and analyze. Modern SMART implementations (in HDDs) also try to
          prevent failures by attempting to detect and repair sector errors. All
          data and all sectors are tested to confirm the drive’s health during
          periods of inactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          ..... it is important to remember that SMART attributes vary in both
          meaning and interpretation by manufacturer. Some attributes are
          considered trade secrets, and not all drives report the same SMART
          attributes.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The same document goes on to describe various attributes supported by
        Samsung’s then monitoring systems. The most important one seems to be
        the "<i>Reallocated Sector Count</i>" attribute:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The raw value of this attribute represents the number of sectors that
        have been moved as a result of a read error, write error, or a
        verification error. If the firmware detects any of these types of
        errors, all valid data in the block the error originates from must be
        transferred to a new block. This number should be low because a high
        number would indicate a large number of failures.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Another important attribute might be the "<i>Wear Leveling Count</i>".
        It represents the number of times a block has been erased. This directly
        relates to the SSD's lifespan, as each NAND flash cell can only be
        erased and rewritten a finite number of times before eventually wearing
        out. For instance,
        <a
          href="https://www.ssd.group/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SZ1735_25_SSD_Spec_v1.1_for_General.pdf"
          >the SZ1735 specification</a
        >
        we looked at earlier has a dedicated section on reliability.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/smt-trim-smart/reliability-specs.png" width="80%" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 3: Reliability specs from Samsung’s SZ1735a Z-SSD
          specification.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To elaborate on these specs, the 30
        <a href="https://www.kingston.com/en/ssd/dwpd">DWPD</a> endurance means
        that we can perform 30 drive writes per day over the component design
        life (i.e., the warranty) of five years. In other words, we can
        overwrite the drive’s entire capacity each day for five years.
        Similarly, the TBW (Total Bytes Written) represents the total amount of
        data
        <a
          href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/understanding-ssd-endurance-drive-writes-per-day-dwpd-terabytes/ba-p/426024"
          >that can be written to the drive during its lifetime</a
        >. Although the specs mention this for us, we can trivially calculate it
        ourselves using the DWPD number, drive size, and warranty period. For an
        800GB SSD with 30 DWPD endurance and a 5 year warranty period, we get a
        TBW of 5 x 365 x 800 x 30 = 43,800,000 GB or 43.8 PB.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Wear Leveling Counts, we need to figure out the average number of
        erasure cycles on SSD blocks. This can be a bit nuanced, as it also
        depends on the NAND cell technology — whether it's SLC, MLC, etc.
        Anyway, how do we find the SMART attributes that my current MacBook
        supports?
      </p>

      <p>
        Well, we can simply run a
        <code>brew install smartmontools</code> followed by
        <code>smartctl -a disk0</code>. This fetches the information. Here is
        what I see on my Macbook Pro:

      <p>
        As you can see, the attributes vary quite a bit. For instance, there is
        no wear leveling count. SSDs tend to reserve spare blocks to replace bad
        ones over time, so having 100% available spare means that all of my
        spare blocks are still intact. The "<i>Data Units Written</i>" probably
        indicates the total amount of data written to the SSD. The final message
        about the read entries from the error information log failing is likely
        because the SSD hasn't encountered any significant errors yet. Oh well!
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I will end this discussion on SMART by pointing out the advice
        Brendan Gregg
        <a
          href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2020-07-15/systems-performance-2nd-edition.html"
          >shared in his book</a
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        While this is very useful, it does not have the resolution to answer
        questions about individual slow disk I/O, as kernel tracing frameworks
        do. The corrected errors information should be useful for monitoring, to
        help predict disk failure before it happens, as well as to confirm that
        a disk has failed or is failing.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Which makes sense to me. If performance diagnostics are what we are
        after, then maybe
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)">perf</a> or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftrace">ftrace</a>
        is the way to go. Nevertheless, it is a pretty neat long-term monitoring
        technology, which I am sure many data centers heavily rely on.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        With all these discussions on SMT, TRIM, and SMART, I kind of forgot to
        talk about the <i>one thing I was bubbling to geek out on!</i> You see,
        whenever we get a new system, our first instinct is to decide how we are
        going to baptize it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having a minimalistic taste, for me, this involved starting with a
        Firefox installation and setting up my favorite addons. This included my
        very own
        <a
          href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup-encyclopedia/"
          >Popup Encyclopedia</a
        >. Next, I imported my precious bookmarks, my password manager, and
        signed in to my online accounts. Once I was done removing the clutter
        from the dock and transferring my personal files, there were only three
        things left to take care of: <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>/<a
          href="https://brew.sh/"
          >Homebrew</a
        >, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, and
        <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a>.
      </p>

      <p>My iTerm2 customizations are really quite simple. All I do is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enable “Copy to pasteboard on selection”</li>
        <li>
          Switch to the “GitHub Dark” ANSI color theme with dark mode editing
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep transparency at 30% — you can switch to an opaque background
          using <code>cmd + U</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that timestamps are always shown on the right —
          <code>shift + cmd + E</code>. This is quite handy when logging
          something.
        </li>
        <li>Switch to 10,000 scrollback lines</li>
        <li>
          Install the
          <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a> font
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This was followed by importing my <code>.zshrc</code> configs. Over the
        years, some nuggets I have curated in it are:
      </p>

      <pre><code style="font-size: 14px;" class="language-bash"># For finding space consuming files and directories

      <p>
        Having UTM is quite handy for testing things out on Windows and Linux.
        Presently, I have configured an ARM-based Debian VM without a desktop
        environment. Next, my plan is to experiment with UTM + Windows 11.

<h1>My Link Log</h1>
<h2>A collection of links which are worth sharing</h2>
<h3>First published: 9/11/19</h3>
<h4>Last updated: 6/12/19</h4>
<p>A while back, I created a <a href="https://github.com/pncnmnp/Bookmark-Manager">bookmark classification</a> utility. Bookmarks have always been an integral part of my web-surfing experience and through this post I intend to share some of my favorite bookmarks. This list will be updated in the future. If you find any link to be dead, try inserting <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px;">https://web.archive.org/</span> ahead of the url.</p>

          to bring about his magnificent attention to detail. If this was indeed
          the case, it makes one wonder just how difficult it must have been for
          Vermeer to trace and paint directly onto the canvases without making
          mistakes. My favorite part in the paper is when Steadman describes the
          glass orb in “The Allegory of Faith” which allegedly provides a small
          glimpse of the camera obscura.

            >Four decades of computer graphics </a
          >: Another paper I came across in my Computer Graphics class. It
          describes the developments in Computer Graphics from the 60s to 90s
          and foreshadows key future developments like VR. Its fascinating that
          the Whirlwind project in 60s had a
          <i>quarter of an acre of electronics</i> and used light pens to
          display information. The 80s certainly seemed like a fun decade for CG
          - CAD/CAM being used in engineering design, better software for
          businesses and graphics art, the emergence of devices such as the
          mouse, sensor gloves, and color printers, and improved standards in
          the graphics community.

          >: Yet another paper I came across in my Computer Graphics class.
          Written by Alvy Ray Smith, this paper describes how the Wrath of Khan
          became the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely
          with computer graphics, and how an incredible team at LucasFilms
          carried forward this task. It is fascinating to see how they were
          pushing the boundaries in 1982 - aiming to have no antialiasing, using
          fractal techniques to reduce the need to manually enter the data,
          creating innovative camera movements using n-dimensional cubic
          splines, and designing a texture mapper for spheres. Fun fact, towards
          the end of the paper, Ray Smith mentions the word <i>Pixar</i>, which
          he describes as a machine being created by LucasFilms to increase the
          speed of computing of the frames by 2x to 3x magnitude!

          So without writing, we are all reduced to a finite automaton!

          linear-probing called <i>graveyard hashing</i> that eliminates primary
          clustering (under certain conditions). This in-turn improves data
          locality. Their strategy involves

          idiv, restricting the use of shared pointers, and explicitly providing

          goes into some specifics on what FB's storage team is doing for
          optimizations - avoiding system calls in hot data path and minimizing
          system calls behind abstraction layers (the example of doing async
          logging using MPSC queue is interesting!), thread pinning, using
          polling instead of interrupts (io_uring) or routing interrupts to a
          small set of non-data path cores, and using huge pages to lower TLB
          misses.

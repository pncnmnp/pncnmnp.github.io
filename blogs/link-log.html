          the case, it makes one wonder just how difficult it must have been for
          Vermeer to trace and paint directly onto the canvases without making
          mistakes. My favorite part in the paper is when Steadman describes the
          glass orb in “The Allegory of Faith” which allegedly provides a small

          describes the developments in Computer Graphics from the 60s to 90s
          and foreshadows key future developments like VR. Its fascinating that
          the Whirlwind project in 60s had a
          <i>quarter of an acre of electronics</i> and used light pens to
          display information. The 80s certainly seemed like a fun decade for CG
          - CAD/CAM being used in engineering design, better software for
          businesses and graphics art, the emergence of devices such as the
          mouse, sensor gloves, and color printers, and improved standards in
          the graphics community.

          Written by Alvy Ray Smith, this paper describes how the Wrath of Khan
          became the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely
          with computer graphics, and how an incredible team at LucasFilms
          carried forward this task. It is fascinating to see how they were
          pushing the boundaries in 1982 - aiming to have no antialiasing, using
          fractal techniques to reduce the need to manually enter the data,
          creating innovative camera movements using n-dimensional cubic
          splines, and designing a texture mapper for spheres. Fun fact, towards
          the end of the paper, Ray Smith mentions the word <i>Pixar</i>, which
          he describes as a machine being created by LucasFilms to increase the
          speed of computing of the frames by 2x to 3x magnitude!

          cache-aware layouts as they do not consider the cache parameters. It
          was interesting to see that the number of cache misses at runtime can
          be computed using the edge span distribution (based on the runtime
          access pattern) and the cache miss ratio function, and that a local
          permutation can help find an optimal edge span distribution. I also

          for chess. Remarkably, their relative values for chess pieces were
          quite similar to the ones later discussed by I. A. Horowitz (in 1951)
          and Bobby Fisher (in 1972). Their evaluation function also took king
          safety, piece mobility, piece safety, castling, pawn advancement, and

          users has raised concerns about privacy and security, leading to
          discussions around regulation. The traditional anti-trust remedies
          involve breaking up their businesses, which is certainly less
          desirable from a consumer experience perspective. This blog post from
          Raghuram Rajan suggests that users should instead own the data they
          generate, and that this data should be stored by a decentralized
          entity that is independent of the firms that use the data. Aggregated
          user data can then be partitioned into different buckets (such as
          advertising and academic research), which can, in turn, be exchanged
          with different businesses in exchange for their services. While this
          idea is certainly not new, I like the concise nature of his blog post
          and how he uses the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an example to
          strengthen his argument.

          Apparently, one of the earliest examples of reinforcement learning
          came from a project by Marvin Minsky called
          <i>SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Computer)</i>.
          Although Minsky's 1952 paper on SNARC appears to be lost, he explained
          its architecture in a 1981 interview with Jeremy Bernstein, a
          theoretical physicist and a staff writer for The New Yorker.
          <details>
            <summary>Relevant part from the interview:</summary>
            <blockquote>
              As an undergraduate, Minsky had begun to imagine building an
              electronic machine that could learn. He had become fascinated by a
              paper that had been written, in 1943, by Warren S. McCulloch, a
              neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a mathematical prodigy. In
              this paper, McCulloch and Pitts created an abstract model of the
              brain cells—the neurons—and showed how they might be connected to
              carry out mental processes such as learning.
              <br />

              "The one I then envisioned would have needed a lot of memory
              circuits. There would be electronic neurons connected by synapses
              that would determine when the neurons fired. The synapses would
              have various probabilities for conducting. But to reinforce
              'success' one would have to have a way of changing these
              probabilities. There would have to be loops and cycles in the
              circuits so that the machine could remember traces of its past and
              adjust its behavior. I thought that if I could ever build such a
              machine I might get it to learn to run mazes through its
              electronics— like rats or something. I didn't think that it would
              be very intelligent. I thought it would work pretty well with
              about forty neurons. Edmonds and I worked out some circuits so
              that —in principle, at least—we could realize each of these
              neurons with just six vacuum tubes and a motor."

              <br />Minsky's machine was certainly one of the first electronic
              learning machines, and perhaps the very first one. In addition to
              its neurons and synapses and its internal memory loops, many of
              the networks were wired at random, so that it was impossible to
              predict what it would do. A "rat" would be created at some point
              in the network and would then set out to learn a path to some
              specified end point. First, it would proceed randomly, and then
              correct choices would be reinforced by making it easier for the
              machine to make this choice again—to increase the probability of
              its doing so. There was an arrangement of lights that allowed
              observers to follow the progress of the rat—or rats. "It turned
              out that because of an electronic accident in our design we could
              put two or three rats in the same maze and follow them all,"
              Minsky told me. "The rats actually interacted with one another. If
              one of them found a good path, the others would tend to follow it.
              We sort of quit science for a while to watch the machine. We were
              amazed that it could have several activities going on at once in
              its little nervous system. Because of the random wiring, it had a
              sort of fail-safe characteristic. If one of the neurons wasn't
              working, it wouldn't make much of a difference —and, with nearly
              three hundred tubes and the thousands of connections we had
              soldered, there would usually be something wrong somewhere. In
              those days, even a radio set with twenty tubes tended to fail a
              lot. I don't think we ever debugged our machine completely, but
              that didn't matter. By having this crazy random design, it was
              almost sure to work, no matter how you built it."

          rendition of the song
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Bell"
            >Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)</a
          >. Interestingly, Arthur C. Clarke, who happened to be present at the
          Bell Labs demonstration, later referenced it in
          <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, where the HAL 9000 computer sings the
          same song to Dave Bowman just before being deactivated. This essay by
          Christoph Cox further discusses this by describing the Vocoder
          technology, what inspired Homer Dudley to build it in 1928, and how
          years later, Alan Turing and his colleagues modified it to create a
          secure speech system called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGSALY">SIGSALY</a> for World
          War II. It also discusses the emergence of computer-generated music.

            <summary>Relevant part from the February 1992 issue:</summary>
            <blockquote>
              For many people, particularly programmers and engineers, the
              Internet means "info- booty": shareware and freeware source code,
              documents, graphics, and data sets available by file transfer
              downloads and from E-mail servers. Sites like UUNET and The World
              each have several gigabytes' worth of publicly available archives.
              These are but two of the hundreds of sites with archives
              accessible via these methods. Even admitting a fair amount of
              redundancy among archives, it still adds up to about 100
              gigabytes, and new sites and offerings are coming on-line every
              day.
              <br />
              With so many different archives, it can be hard to figure out
              where (and at what network address) to access the items you want.
              If you don't know what you want beyond compilers or CP/M
              applications, it's even more overwhelming.
              <br />
              The "archie group" at McGill University (Montreal, Quebec, Canada)
              has one solution to the problem: archie (archive without the v),
              the Internet Archive Server Listing Service (for access, see
              reference 2). Archie is a central database of information about
              Internet-accessible archive sites, plus server programs that
              provide access by telnet, anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP),
              E-mail, and the Prospero distributed computer system.

          >: Two of the most common collision resolution strategies are chaining
          and open addressing. In open addressing, linear probing is widely
          used. Furthermore, when deleting an element in a linear probing
          scheme, tombstones are often used to mark the deleted element.
          However, this strategy wastes memory and increases the frequency of
          expensive rehashing. This blog post by <i>attractivechaos</i> proposes
          a clever deletion strategy without tombstones. When deleting an
          element, the strategy moves the next element to the deleted location
          if it was pushed away by the deleted element due to hash collision.
          This process recurses until an empty location is reached. Isn't that
          marvelous? <i>attractivechaos</i> has shown that this strategy can
          work surprisingly well in practice. I am curious to compare it with
          graveyard hashing.

          >: A beautiful algorithm by Renato Budinich to create random images
          using a two-step procedure. The first step involves taking a random
          gray-valued mask image and applying the path-finding procedure of the
          <i>Easy Path Wavelet Transform</i> (EPWT) to it. This path-finding
          technique is greedy and aims to obtain a succession of vectorized
          pixel values with minimal variation. It does this by always picking
          the next point (among the available neighbors) that yields the minimum
          absolute value difference in pixel values. This approach helps it
          select regions with similar pixel values before making a jump to
          pixels with significantly lighter or darker regions. Once a random
          path of length N is obtained, a random color map is applied, with each
          point k in the path mapped to the k/N point in the color map. Et
          voilà! A gorgeous image emerges.

          problems based on logic and probability. A central theme amongst many
          of them was that the problem involved some sort of game - such as
          chess, name cards, and word games. To call these problems intriguing
          would be an understatement - there's an uncrossed knight's tour
          problem, a variant of chess where the first person to check the
          opponent's king wins, a variant of the urn problem, and, a word game.
          I have provided an analysis on this word game

            >Play Tic-Tac-Toe with Knuth</a
          >: This little blog post from Russ Cox has amazed me for a long time.
          This year, I finally got the opportunity to go over TAOCP Volume 4A,
          hoping to understand Knuth's algorithm. The algorithm discusses how
          optimal tic-tac-toe moves can be represented using Boolean logic.<br />
          He starts by picturing two 3x3 grids - one for the X’s and another for
          the O’s. This setup introduces 18 boolean variables - x1 to x9 for the
          X's, and o1 to o9 for the O's.<br />
          Now, creating a full-scale truth table for these 18 variables means we
          would be looking at 2^18, or 262,144 rows. However, it turns out only
          4520 of those are legal inputs. So, the question becomes, how do we
          find patterns in this boolean chain to build our tic-tac-toe
          strategies.<br />
          Knuth simplifies it by considering only the following strategies -
          (a.) winning - when putting an X in a cell wins the game - like when
          two cells in any line already have X's. (b.) blocking - when putting
          an X in a cell stops the other player from winning - like when two
          cells in any line have O's. (c.) forking - when putting an X in a cell
          opens up multiple winning moves - you store all the winning line
          possibilities (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines - all 9) in a
          set, and for each winning line (say {i, j, k}), you place an X on i,
          leave k empty, and see if a move on j creates two win chances. (d.)
          defending - similar, when putting an X in a cell stops the other
          player from creating multiple win chances. (e.) And just making any
          legal move - when a cell does not have an X or an O.<br />
          The priority order of moves follows the order above. There's also a
          bit of priority within the legal moves - like the middle spot is best
          since it's part of more winning lines, while the edges are the last
          choice.

          <i>
            as there are an infinite number of ghost legs representing a
            particular permutation, those ghost legs have a kind of equivalence.
            Among those equivalent ghost legs, the ones which have smallest
            number of legs are called "prime"</i
          >. Fascinatingly, there is a relationship between ghost legs and
          bubble sort. Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by
          repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.
          This effectively "bubbles up" the largest unsorted element to its
          correct position in each iteration through the array. If you think of
          a ghost leg's end configuration as a shuffled sequence, then the
          process of adding legs to revert it back to the initial sorted state
          with the minimum number of moves would be analogous to bubble sort. In
          other words, each leg would represent a swap that bubble sort would
          perform. There is also an algorithm to parallelize a ghost leg;
          however, I leave that up to the curious reader to explore. Hint:
          red-black balls.

          >: John Graham-Cumming narrates the fascinating story of the 1951
          business computer LEO I, one of the world's first, which was handed a
          big data problem by the British Rail: to calculate the shortest
          distance between each of their 5,500 railway stations. What follows is
          an engineering feat that spanned over 9 months - the discovery of
          Dijkstra's algorithm years before Dijkstra published it, optimizations
          to distribute the data processing tasks, and the fascinating use of
          punch cards. Tim Greening-Jackson has also documented this story in
          his paper on

          >: There is a pedestrian bridge that crosses I-494 just west of the
          Minneapolis Airport, connecting Bloomington to Richfield. Hundreds of
          thousands of cars drive under it, but why is it there, especially in
          an area that is neither particularly walkable nor connected to any
          establishments? In this blog post, the author investigates this
          seemingly irrelevant yet surprisingly fun internet mystery.

        <h1>My Undergraduate Reference Books</h1>
        <h2>First Published: 28/04/21</h2>
        <p>As I am about to complete my undergraduate studies (in Computer Engineering - 2017 to 2021), I have decided to dedicate this blogpost to list down all the reference books/lecture notes I have used in the past 4 years. In the future, if I further recall any important references, I will surely update this blog post. This list will be particularly helpful to students enrolled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mumbai">Mumbai University</a>. Unless otherwise mentioned, do assume that the books were purchased from <mark>amazon.in</mark>.</p>

        <p>For most of the core subjects in Computer Engineering, I <b>do not recommend</b> reading guides. They are often plagiarized, filled with grammatical and conceptual errors, and contain low-quality images. If you have recently started your undergraduate studies, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a>.</p>

        <p>A <a href="https://csgordon.github.io/books.html">list of computer science reference materials</a> that are <b>freely available</b> is compiled by Prof. Colin Gordon. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25572852">Hacker News</a> discussion)</p>

        <p>Although I never took GATE, the <a href="http://www.gate.iitg.ac.in/Syllabi/CS_Computer-Science-and-Information-Technology.pdf">syllabus prescribed by the exam authorities</a> and reference list mentioned by <a href="https://engineering.careers360.com/articles/gate-2015-topper-interview-ravi-shankar-mishra-air-1-in-computer-science-engineering">Ravi Shankar Mishra in 2015</a> were particularly influential.</p>

        <h2>The C Programming Language</h2>
        <h3>Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/kernighan_ritchie.jpg">

        <h2>Discrete Mathematics and its Applications</h2>
        <h3>Kenneth Rosen</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/kenneth_rosen.jpg">
        <p>In Addition: Lecture notes by <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf">L. Lovasz and K. Vesztergombi (Yale University, Spring 1999)</a>, and by <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_notes.pdf">Eric Lehman, Tom Leighton, and Albert Meyer (MIT, 2010)</a> are helpful.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/clrs.jpg">
        <p>In Addition: <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">Competitive Programmer’s Handbook by Antti Laaksonen (Draft July 3, 2018)</a> is helpful. For a dive into advanced data structures, I recommend exploring <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/cs166.1196/handouts/100%20Suggested%20Final%20Project%20Topics.pdf">Topics in Advanced Data Structures</a> (Stanford CS166 - Spring 2019, relevant <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19780387">Hacker News discussion</a>).</p>

        <h2>Digital Design</h2>
        <h3>Morris Mano and Michael Ciletti</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/morris_mano.jpg">
        <p>In Addition: For a quick summary, I recommend reading Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth Rosen (Chapter 10 - Boolean Algebra).</p>

        <h2>Computer Organization</h2>
        <h3>Carl Hamacher, Zvonko Vranesic, and Safwat Zaky</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/carl_hamacher.jpg">
        <p>An interesting quote from the book: <i>Two things that can wreck a good CPU run are interrupts and page faults.</i></p>
        <p>In Addition: Prof. V Kamakoti's lectures on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxB5s7fKeSjNm5ihSbmgv9yF0KjKY_yp2">Computer Organization and Architecture</a> (IIT Madras) are very intuitive.</p>

        <h2>Operating System Principles</h2>
        <h3>Avi Silberschatz, Peter Galvin, and Greg Gagne</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/galvin.jpg">
        <p>In Addition: <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau</a> is a good substitute. While I have yet to go through <a href="https://greenteapress.com/thinkos/thinkos.pdf">Think OS: A Brief Introduction to Operating Systems by Allen Downey</a>, do check it out.</p>

        <h2>Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach</h2>
        <h3>James Kurose and Keith Ross</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/kurose_ross.jpg">
        <p>In my opinion: Many computer networking courses (taught to Computer Engineering students) in India start with the physical layer and move upwards to the data link layer. While following this approach, the professors often skip the application layer due to time constraints. As mentioned in this book's title, it takes a reverse approach - <b>starting with the application layer and skipping the physical layer</b>. I strongly believe that the book's top-down approach is the best way to teach a computer networking class. Moreover, the diagrams presented in this book are highly intuitive.</p>
        <p>In Addition: <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/dheeraj/cs425/">Lecture Notes by Prof. Dheeraj Sanghi</a> (IIT Kanpur - CS425) are a great resource.</p>

        <h2>An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata</h2>
        <h3>Peter Linz</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/peter_linz.jpg">
        <p>In Addition: <a href="https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Extra/Richard_P._Feynman-Feynman_Lectures_on_Computation__-Addison-Wesley%281996%29.pdf">Feynman Lectures on Computation</a> (Chapter 3 - The Theory of Computation), and <a href="https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/models/all-models.pdf">Models of Computation by Jeff Erickson</a> are helpful.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</h2>
        <h3>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/russell_norvig.jpg">

        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>Tom Mitchell</h3>
        <img src="./pics/undergrad-books-images/tom_mitchell.jpg">
        <p>Alternative: I recommend referring to <a href="https://github.com/vkosuri/CourseraMachineLearning">Andrew Ng's <b>weekly</b> lecture notes</a> from Coursera and <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville</a>. Moreover, r/machinelearning has a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fdw0ax/d_advanced_courses_update/">curated list of advanced courses</a> in machine learning.</p>

        <h2>Database System Concepts</h2>

For non-neural NLP models, <a href="https://www.nltk.org/book/">Natural Language Processing with Python</a> by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper is a great resource.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://www.mmds.org/#ver30">Mining of Massive Datasets</a></h2>
        <h3>Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman</h3>

      <h1>My bookshelf in 2026</h1>
      <h2>Last Edited: 01/01/2026</h2>

      <p>
        I read quite a bit every year. For 2026, I have decided to document all
        of my <i>book readings</i> in this blog post. I have other reading too;
        primarily, I have a
        <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/">CACM journal subscription</a> and read a
        fair amount on
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and random
        research papers as well. However, I will only be documenting my book
        readings. This is purely for experimental purposes, and to look back on
        this year - years from now - and reflect on a snapshot of my reading. At
        present, I have no expectation of continuing this experiment in 2027 and
        beyond. Hope you find this list fun!
      </p>

      <h2>The Code Book</h2>
      <p>
        By <i>Simon Singh</i>. This book traces the history of cryptography,
        from Mary, Queen of Scots and substitution ciphers, to Charles Babbage
        and Vigenère ciphers, to Enigma machines, and the Polish and British
        efforts in cracking them during WWII. By far, my favorite discussion was
        on the Beale Papers, the Navajo code talkers, and how hieroglyphs were
        deciphered using the Rosetta Stone. The section on the Beale Papers is
        really well written, to the point that I'm quite tempted to take a stab
        at it. Maybe I will! I have previously delved a bit into the Enigma
        machines, primarily through Professor Brailsford's videos on
        Computerphile. I highly encourage you to check out his "<a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvKdOEHkrJc"
          >Enigma, TypeX and Dad</a
        >" video, where he narrates a personal story about Ultra intelligence
        and Winterbotham (something that is mentioned in the book as well). A
        while back, I also found a rather fun article from Babbage's
        <a
          href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Babbage_deciphering/"
          >Passages from the Life of a Philosopher</a
        >
        that briefly describes his fascination with ciphers. However, this book
        is really on a different level and neatly ties the threads of history
        together.

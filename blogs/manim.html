        <h1>Software worth exploring - Manim</h1>
        <p>When I started this blog, I wanted my blog-posts to be about ideas and experiences. The motive was to write content that never sinks and is somehow able to float through time. This is why I usually shy away from writing blog-posts about frameworks, libraries, or even languages and why I am paranoid about archiving thought-provoking web-pages. However, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine)</a> and explored it for a while, I knew this warranted a blog-post.</p>

        <p>Although Grant Sanderson (the author of Manim) likes to call it an <i>animation engine</i>, after playing around for a while, I found it akin to an <i>imagination engine</i>. The ability to craft beautiful animations and text so effortlessly has amazed me the most. Here is a video I made using Manim: </p>

        <video controls>
            <source src="./videos/coreference_resolution.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <p style="text-align: center;">An introduction on Coreference Resolution (the topic of our bachelor thesis)</p>

        <p>From what I have observed, Manim renders each animation separately and then combines it to produce the entire video. As I have not explored much of the mathematical side of Manim, I will primarily share links for the text-rendering part.</p>

        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>If some of the Github links are missing, I suggest going to commit aff2d21.</p>

        If you want some amazing code examples, I highly suggest you skim the repositories <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/manimlib/for_3b1b_videos/">for_3b1b_videos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim/tree/master/from_3b1b">from_3b1b</a>. It contains the code Grant Sanderson has used for his youtube channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Blue1Brown">3blue1brown</a>. For example, when I wanted to underline a text, I found the relevant code in <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/manimlib/for_3b1b_videos/common_scenes.py#L209">common_scenes.py</a>.

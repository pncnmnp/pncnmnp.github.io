<h1>Crafting a static site</h1>
<p>Crafting this site has been one of the most fun-filled experiences I've had in the past 2 years. Through this blog post, I intend to give you a glimpse of my journey making a static website.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that this site is hosted on Github Pages, but things were different in 2016 when I had no clue what Github was. For a noob who had no experience in [ Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript ], Wordpress came as a savior. Within two hours or so my first <a href="https://pncnmnp.wordpress.com/">website</a> was up and running. It was later the next day that I realized the speed and ease of use came at a major cost, not only was the site unintuitive but managing it was an ordeal.</p>
<p>It was in 2018, when I was again determined to create my site. After a brief stint with Jekyll ( which gave me the old Wordpress vibes ), I decided it was time to start experimenting. I had the following objectives in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site should load extremely fast</li>
<li>No use of Javascript</li>
<li>Clutter-free design</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above principles, I hosted the site on <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pncnmnp/pncnmnp.github.io/blob/b74c0541cba7248a94f91031bd551460aa74fb14/index.html">Github Pages</a> but it was far from perfect. One of the most important aspects of web design is accessibility. With <i>monospace</i> as the default font, text inside &lt;pre&gt; tags, and no use of <i>viewport</i> property the site was inaccessible.</p>
<p>The following months went into creating a blog section and making the site more accessible. I also added a native dark mode and syntax highlighting for my blogs ( both in JS ). From my experience, three things have to be taken care of when using JS on the web - is the site accessible without it, does it seriously affect performance and lastly does it violate user's privacy. A lot of web developers feel that screen readers, no-JS users, and text-based browsers are not worth supporting, while I hold a contradicting opinion, I strongly believe every page should fail gracefully. A brilliant discussion discussing the pros and cons of supporting no-JS has been conducted on <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25969/should-i-bother-to-develop-for-javascript-disabled">Stack Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>My priorities for this site have drastically changed since 2019. Today I use a custom <a href="https://github.com/pncnmnp/Markdown-to-HTML">Markdown-to-HTML parser</a> to write these blog posts. Producing quality content, making the site accessible to all devices out there and complementing all that with a clean UI are the only objectives I am aiming at.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to end the blog post with a collection of web design and internet-architecture related links you might find interesting:</p>

        There is something about a dense medium that excites me greatly. For me,
        this goes beyond just technical articles and books, extending to urban
        city planning and even movies with rich, complex, and rapid-fire
        conversations. Take one of my favorite films, for instance —
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)">
          12 Angry Men
        </a>
        — a movie entirely set in one location, a jury room, where twelve men do
        nothing but deliberate the fate of a boy accused of murder. When it
        comes to city planning, I enjoy cities that are densely packed with
        hotspots, where I can travel almost anywhere on foot with the addition
        of some public transportation.

        With a taste like that, visiting <b>Washington, D.C.</b> had been on my
        list for quite some time. This November, I finally managed to make it
        happen during my Thanksgiving break. For me, this trip was practically a
        frog’s leap away from where I live. Now, I am no travel blogger, and
        this is no travel blog, but the itinerary I designed for the trip
        exceeded my initial expectations to the point that I am happy to share
        it below:

          Figure 1: I flew in on a Wednesday, and Thursday was Thanksgiving —
          nearly all Smithsonian museums are open on Thanksgiving and the day
          after. At the National Gallery of Art, I started in the West Building
          with Da Vinci and moved toward the East Building. At the National
          Museum of American History, I managed to explore the Entertainment
          Nation, American Enterprise, America on the Move, and The Price of
          Freedom exhibits — all of which were quite fun and recommended. The
          Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is a must-visit!

        ….. if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every
        art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's
        work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the
        whole works, right? But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like
        in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up
        at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. …..

        However, it is only now that I have fully experienced and internalized
        his words. I tell you, standing in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art"
          >National Gallery of Art</a
        >, among the works of Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Monet, Van Gogh,
        Picasso, and Pollock was quite an experience. Only now can I say that I
        have seen the thickness of Van Gogh’s strokes and the madness that
        likely lay within, as well as the dance of light and shadow that
        Rembrandt displayed. Vermeer’s work excited me the most, though — the
        use of light, the use of light! And the attention to detail. It was the
        most magnificent thing.

        At NC State, I had the pleasure of taking Prof. Ben Watson’s class on
        <a href="https://cgclass.csc.ncsu.edu/">Computer Graphics</a>. Among his
        many readings, one involved “<a
          href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4130314"
          >Allegory, Realism, and Vermeer’s Use of the Camera Obscura</a
        >”. In <a href="./link-log.html">my link logs</a>, I very briefly
        summarized this paper as:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        I came across this paper in my Computer Graphics class. Philip Steadman
        describes how Johannes Vermeer used a camera obscura to bring about his
        magnificent attention to detail. If this was indeed the case, it makes
        one wonder just how difficult it must have been for Vermeer to trace and
        paint directly onto the canvases without making mistakes. My favorite
        part in the paper is when Steadman describes the glass orb in “The
        Allegory of Faith” which allegedly provides a small glimpse of the
        camera obscura.
      </blockquote>

        It’s a nice little rabbit hole to dive into.
        <i>Hoppity hop, white rabbit flip-flop!</i> There is also a fascinating
        documentary on this subject by Penn and Teller called
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPL7D0Ha1kQ">Tim’s Vermeer</a>.
        However, standing there in the gallery, I all but forgot about the
        camera obscura. It does that to you. Anyways, enough of being a
        romantic.

        Let us shift gears to another museum — and the focal point of this blog
        —
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Postal_Museum"
          >Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum</a
        >. It is located on Massachusetts Avenue, right next to Union Station.
        <i
          >Never would I have imagined that a postal museum could bring me so
          much excitement</i
        >. The museum itself is quite small compared to the other Smithsonians.
        However, this, I believe, is its best feature — it doesn’t overwhelm you
        with information.

        There are various permanent exhibits. One exhibit focuses on the “Gems
        of American Philately”, which includes stamps like the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Black">Penny Black</a> (the
        world’s first adhesive postage stamp), a stamp from the

        stamp, and, of course, the 5c Franklin and 10c Washington stamps (<a

          >the first U.S. postage stamps</a
        >). At one of the exits of that exhibit, there is a large table piled
        with stamps. The catch, though, is that you can take home only six
        complimentary stamps! It’s a perfect way to slow down the hands of time
        as you sift through the heap, sorting and filtering the stamps to your
        liking. They even provide free postcards for you to write to your family
        and friends!

        What fascinated me the most, though, was their “Systems at Work”
        exhibit, which featured the automatic
        <b>Carrier Sequence Bar Code Sorter</b>, also known as CSBCS. From their
        exhibit:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        For decades, mail carriers had to sort their mail into its delivery
        sequence before they went out on their routes. This process often took
        several hours. The Carrier Sequence Bar Code Sorter (CSBCS) was one of
        the first widely implemented machines that automated the sorting of mail
        down to the delivery sequence. Mail could go directly from the CSBCS to
        the carrier — in order and ready to be delivered.
      </blockquote>

        "
          >Clive “Max” Maxfield’s blog post</a
        >
        on the United States Postal Service (USPS) probably provides the best
        introduction to CSBCS’ role through the lens of USPS’ entire pipeline:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        When you post a letter, it’s quickly transported to the nearest major
        mail hub. As soon as it arrives at the hub, the mail is fed into a
        machine that captures an image of its handwritten or printed address.
        This image is transmitted to powerful computers that perform incredibly
        sophisticated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in real time. Based on
        this, additional software determines the destination that the originator
        of this piece of mail had in mind. It then accesses a national database
        to “fill in the gaps.” The result is translated into a POSTNET barcode
        that is printed onto the mail as it passes at high speed through the
        machine. This barcode is subsequently used to guide the mail throughout
        the remainder of its journey. <br />

        Next, the mail is sorted with respect to whichever major hub is closest
        to its ultimate destination. It is then transported to that hub. In the
        not-so-distant past, the mail would eventually end up at some main local
        mail facility. Here, the mail would be fed into a Carrier Sequence Bar
        Code Sorter (CSBCS), which would read its barcode and sort the mail into
        the Carrier Route Sequence ….. That is, the mail would be sorted based
        on the order in which it would be delivered by the carriers serving that
        community. <br />

        The old CSBCS machines were around 6 ft. wide, 4 ft. tall, and 12 ft.
        long. Approximately 4000 of these units were deployed at local
        facilities around the country. These machines performed their duties
        admirably for many years. But time moved on and they were eventually
        superseded by new technological developments. Now, the task of sorting
        the mail into the Carrier Route Sequence is performed at the central
        hubs. Each hub is equipped with an advanced Delivery Barcode Sorter
        (DBCS). The size of these monster devices varies depending on the
        installation. But they can easily be several hundred feet in length.
        Following the introduction of the DBCS machines, the original CSBCS
        units were decommissioned and stored in a warehouse facility in Topeka,
        KS. Destined for the scrapheap, their future looked bleak until….<br />

          >1994 patent</a

        also provides a good overview of its workings. The cameras used by CSBCS
        machines to scan POSTNET barcodes were known as
        <a
          href="https://arkansasresearch.uark.edu/this-u-of-a-invention-is-used-by-the-post-office-every-day/"
        >
          Wide-Angle Bar Code Readers
        </a>
        (WABCR). Before WABCR cameras, the barcode reader had to be lined up
        directly over the barcode to decode it. This required barcodes to be
        placed at exactly the same distance from the edges of the envelope,
        which proved to be surprisingly challenging. WABCR mitigated this issue,
        but it was soon after replaced by the superior
        <a href="https://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs04/chp2-011.html"
          >wide field of view</a
        >
        (WFOV) cameras from Lockheed Martin:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Deployment of more than 9,000 wide field of view (WFOV) cameras was
        completed in early 2004. The WFOV cameras replaced the aging and
        obsolete wide area barcode readers (WABCRs) on all existing DBCS, DIOSS,
        and carrier sequence barcode sorter (CSBCS) machines. This camera system
        can read information based indicia (IBI) codes and demonstrated a
        significant improvement over the WABCR in reading Postal Numeric
        Encoding Technique (POSTNET) and Postal Alpha Numeric Encoding Technique
        (PLANET) barcodes.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, there is little to no public information on their
        internal workings. Furthermore, as I understand it, none of these
        technologies are in use today.
        <i
          >As they say, the moving finger writes; and, having writ, moves on.</i

      <p>
        Anyways, amidst all these assortments, I found a new hobby —
        <b>philately</b>, or stamp collecting! The National Postal Museum seems
        to have a partnership with the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystic_Stamp_Company"
          >Mystic Stamp Company</a
        >, whereby, upon filling out an online form, you can get two hundred
        free stamps delivered within a week. And lo and behold, I did just that!
      </p>

      <p>
        As it turns out, philately is a surprisingly inexpensive hobby. You can
        buy these $10-$20 packets filled with hundreds of U.S. and international
        stamps from sites like Etsy and spend countless hours going through
        them, checking out their history, sorting them, and finally arranging
        them neatly in a book. All you need is a $4 pack of 1,000 stamp hinges,
        a $4 magnifying glass, a $5 acid-free sketchbook with thick pages, and a
        $1.50 pair of tweezers. <i>And that’s really it.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Long gone are the days when stamp collecting used to be an investment.
        In fact, many stamps have been depreciating in value for quite some time
        now. This is no longer the Churchill and Roosevelt era. My
        recommendation? Treat it as a hobby, and you’ll enjoy every second of
        it. Here are some interesting stamps I got from the Mystic Stamp
        Company:
      </p>

          Figure 6: A glimpse of some of the stamps I got from the Mystic Stamp
          Company.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Now, one of the things about U.S. stamps is that, to the best of my
        knowledge, they have never released a stamp series showcasing the U.S.’
        technological advancements in computers and computer science. A tad bit
        surprising, if you ask me, considering the fact that the country has
        produced stamps featuring Mickey Mouse, Wile E. Coyote, and even Popeye,
        the spinach man. So I thought to myself,
        <i>can I create stamps using generative AI?</i> One thing led to
        another, and I ended up with the crazy idea of mixing artistic styles
        with such stamps.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, what would you get if you combined the realism of the
        Renaissance, like Da Vinci’s works, with the Antikythera mechanism? How
        about Salvador Dalí’s surrealism on a stamp featuring a vacuum tube? Van
        Gogh’s impressionism with transistors? Matisse’s fauvism with the
        internet? Picasso’s cubist style plus artificial intelligence? Jackson
        Pollock’s drip-madness with emails? Edward Hopper's urban realism +
        hacker culture? And finally, Monet + Silicon Valley?
      </p>

      <p>
        After trial and error, and some more trial and error, and even more
        trial and error, here’s my <b>Computing Stamp Series</b>:
      </p>

      <figure>

      <p>
        I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">Dall-E 3</a> to
        generate these images. To make them detailed, I started with a skeleton
        prompt, which was expanded into a more detailed prompt using
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o">GPT 4o</a>, which in turn
        went on to create the images. It was important not to use the word
        “Picasso” or “Monet” in the prompt, as our young Padawan has a tad bit
        of phobia when it comes to such words. Wink, wink. To give you an
        example, here is the exact prompt I used to generate the Picasso stamp:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Create an upright, stamp-sized illustration in a Cubist style, depicting
        an abstract concept of artificial intelligence (AI) through fragmented
        and geometric shapes. Use layered panes and interconnected elements to
        symbolize complexity and networks, incorporating abstract motifs like
        flowing lines, interconnected nodes, and stylized patterns resembling
        data flow or neural circuits. Avoid literal depictions of human faces or
        detailed realism, instead focusing on abstraction and dynamic
        compositions.<br />
        The illustration should feature a muted color palette with occasional
        bold contrasts, evoking depth and intrigue. The image must fit strictly
        within the stamp area, surrounded by classic postage stamp perforations
        along the edges. The area outside the stamp (above, below, and on the
        sides) must be completely empty, filled with pitch black. There should
        be no background within the stamp area itself, only the Cubist
        abstraction of AI.<br />
        On the top right corner, engrave "USA" subtly in a bold, vintage serif
        font that complements the Cubist and old-school aesthetic. Ensure the
        proportions are balanced, the composition is centered, and the
        dimensions are precise to fit neatly inside the stamp’s perforated
        borders. The focus should remain entirely on the artistic and abstract
        interpretation of AI while adhering to the strict stamp-sized format.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        And that’s it, folks! I would have preferred to take a jab at
        non-fungible tokens, but I’m a bit disinterested in doing so. Safe to
        say, the generative AI work above is nothing more than a transitionary
        piece to admire. I have quite a few technical blog posts lined up next.
        In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed this bottle episode.
        <i>Until next time! Happy exploring!</i>

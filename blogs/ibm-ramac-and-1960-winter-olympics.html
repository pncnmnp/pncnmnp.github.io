        <i
          ><u>James Porter</u>: Let me interrupt Wes, to point out to people
          when they see this, a little bit of background. Wes lived through the
          Second World War as a bomber pilot. At one point in the South Pacific,
          Wes' s plane was shot down and several members of his crew were
          killed. He was lucky to get out of the plane, lucky to get out of the
          jungle that he had to go through for several days to survive. Yet when
          he went to work for IBM he almost got killed by a disk drive.
          (laughter) </i
        ><br />
        <i
          ><u>Wesley Dickinson</u>: The thing that kept us from getting killed
          was a shield that Don Johnson invented to put around the whole RAMAC
          disk assembly. It slowed down the shrapnel. Leonard and I were the
          only ones in the room. We started it up. It didn't even get up to full
          speed before it started to fly apart. The shaft spacers were without
          any disks on them because we just had one disk each on the bottom and
          top. There was nothing to contain the spacers. The spacers started to
          break because there was an intentionally cut slot through on one side
          to make them easier to put on the big shaft - it was about six-inches
          in diameter. Leonard suffered a cut tendon in his thumb. In my case it
          hit me on the nose and broke my nose. The same piece hit me near my
          right eye and on the side of my face. Both of us went to the hospital.
          In my case it was much easier, I only had a little broken nose. I have
          a big nose anyhow. For Leonard, they had to go in and do some work and
          tie things together in his thumb. That really preceded the time we
          were able to read and write or try to read and write. Without Don
          Johnson's plastic shield on there ~ I think they were actually
          Plexiglas - we probably wouldn't be around today. That reminds me,
          when I got shot down if I would have been this much (a few inches) to
          the right, I wouldn't be here today. </i

        I had a smackdackingly memorable summer! You know how little princesses
        dream about living in the biggest castles, and vampires dream of
        drinking the most exquisite blood? Well, for a long time, I had a dream
        of visiting the Bay Area and exploring the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_History_Museum

          >Computer History Museum</a

      </p>
      <p>
        For a multi-trillion dollar industry, we sure seem to have a shortage of
        computer museums. Growing up in Mumbai, I couldn’t find any. As recently
        as 2019, the big three museums I dreamed of visiting were the Computer
        History Museum (CHM) near Googleplex, Paul Allen’s

        in Bletchley Park. Unfortunately, during COVID-19, LCM shut down, never
        to open again, and a few months ago, the Paul Allen Estate announced
        that

          the museum would be permanently closed with its items auctioned off</a
        >. A real bummer, cause I lived in Seattle the summer of ’22 and would
        have loved to thoroughly explore the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the CHM trip was fantastic. I got to see one of Waymo’s earliest
        prototypes, a bunch of slide rules and mechanical calculators, found a
        bunch of retro advertisements and posters to explore further, learned
        about the Silicon Valley Napkin, Michael Noll’s work on
        computer-generated art, the U.S. Navy’s Project 91, IBM capitalizing on
        FDR’s Social Security Act, got to be up close to Jacquard’s loom cards
        and their fabrics, finally got to play Pac-Man the way it was supposed
        to be played, saw the Enigma machine, the Apollo Guidance Computer, the
        world’s first RAM chip used in the Whirlwind Computer, Cray-1, a
        Wozniak-signed Apple 1, one of Google’s earliest servers, the original
        Ethernet cable, PDP-1, and much, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Innocently wandering into their gift shop, I asked one of the attendants
        if they had punch cards for purchase. In a jiffy, he went to the back
        and brought out a whole stack, giving me a few blank punch cards to keep
        for free. My first punch cards! If you plan to visit CHM, I encourage
        you to do so on Saturday mornings to see their
        <a href="https://computerhistory.org/exhibits/ibm1401/">IBM 1401</a> in
        action. They even have demos on
        <a href="https://computerhistory.org/exhibits/pdp-1/">PDP-1</a> and
        Spacewar on certain Saturdays. Alas, I went there on a Friday. Maybe
        next time.

        and the topic of this blog post. So, what was so special about the 1960
        Winter Olympics, and what is its connection with the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_305_RAMAC">IBM 305 RAMAC</a>?
        What is the IBM 305 RAMAC?
      </p>
      <p>
        Possibly, the perfect way to describe this would be by showing a poster
        present in their Olympic museum:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/ibm-ramac/olympics-tech-poster.jpeg" />
        <figcaption>Figure 2: The Olympics Go High Tech</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The poster says the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        One of the most exciting additions to the VIII Olympic Winter Games was
        the use of the IBM RAMAC 305 data processing machine. Prior to the 1960
        Winter Games, all event scoring was calculated by hand using adding
        machines. Athletes and spectators sometimes had to wait as many as five
        hours for official results to be called. The IBM RAMAC 305 changed the
        face of the Olympic Games by providing up-to-the-second accounts of
        athletes’ standings in each of the 26 events.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        The RAMAC, which had 5 megabytes of hard disk space, was a large machine
        housed in the glass-walled Olympic Data Processing Center (now the Ski
        Rental Building). Twenty six volunteers operated the computer, often
        attracting as many spectators as the events themselves.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        During each event, judges on the scene sent competitors’ performance
        data to the Olympic Data Processing Center. Data processors then added
        the information to the competitors’ punch cards and fed the cards into
        the computer. Within seconds, the completed results were printed out on
        “high speed” 80 line-per-minute printers for review by the judges before
        being posted. Electronic data processing thus made it possible to
        determine winners of most Olympic events in less than two minutes.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        One of the first thoughts I had when I read this was: what kind of
        calculations were done that required as many as five hours for official
        results to be declared? I found an answer to this in the
        <a
          href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/medford-mail-tribune-ibm-ramac-squaw-val/11373374/
        "
        >
          Medford Mail Tribune’s January 11, 1959 edition</a
        >. The then Olympic Games Organizing Committee president, Prentis C.
        Hale, had the following to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Hale noted that final placings in previous Winter Olympics have often
        been unavailable for as long as five hours after an event because of
        involved manual calculations … Preliminary planning by IBM personnel
        include a detailed six-month study of winter sports events scoring
        procedures with the subsequent development of programs for IBM
        equipment.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        In addition to score computations, RAMAC's huge memory file will contain
        biographical and past-performance information on every competitor,
        including a 200-word biography with an additional 200-word brief of past
        and current performances.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Whenever information Is desired on a competitor, RAMAC's memory file
        will be "queried" and the reply will be automatically printed within
        seconds. The questioner may specify his answer be in French, the
        official language of the Olympics, or in English - the alternate
        language. Events to be scored by RAMAC include speed skating, figure
        skating and all ski events - slaloms, downhills, cross-country races and
        jumping. Hale pointed out that scoring has always been necessarily slow
        for such competitions as figure skating, Nordic combined events and
        jumping because of the complex formulas necessary to convert
        performances into scoring points.

        To understand the complexity better, take figure skating as an example.
        <a

        "
          >Olympedia</a

        had the following to say about the 1960 figure skating scoring:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Men and women skated compulsory figures and a free skating program, with
        the compulsory figures counting towards 60% of the final score, while
        pairs skated a single free skate program. Overall placements were
        determined by the majority placement system. The compulsory figures were
        changed from six to five figures, but the percentages were not changed.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        To elaborate on this, it seems that individual skaters competed in two
        parts: the 'compulsory figures' and the 'free skating program.' In the
        former, skaters had to perform a series of prescribed moves on the ice
        and were likely judged on their accuracy and overall control. The latter
        allowed for a more creative display where skaters could showcase their
        skills in jumps, spins, and footwork. As mentioned, the compulsory
        figures counted for 60% of the final score, whereas free skating
        accounted for 40%. From what I can make, the majority placement system
        likely refers to the fact that there were multiple judges. Each judge
        would rank the skaters (or assign a score) after their segments, and the
        overall placement was determined by the majority of the judges'
        rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were 19 men and 26 women participating in this competition in
        1960. <i>Indeed, a lot of calculations!</i>

        Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the IBM 305 RAMAC was that it
        <b>was the first computer to use a random-access disk drive</b>, the
        origins of which are narrated by
        <a

      <blockquote>
        Jim: When did it start to gel - the project to do something with the
        disk?
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Lou: Rey assigned Art Critchlow to do a study. Rey had always been
        interested in source recording per se; source recording being key
        punching. Rey had built the 026 key punch in Endicott and he had done a
        lot of other source recording-like things - that's conversion of
        something to punch card format. So he assigned Art Critchlow to look at
        the source recording problem - how could we get information into the
        punch card at the earliest possible time? Art looked at lots and lots of
        different alternatives. It was obvious there should be some sort of a
        storage medium - unchanging data. He ran across a thing called a tub
        file. A tub file was a place where you stored pre-punched cards. To do
        an invoice, you'd pick a card of the customer and his address and a card
        for each of the items on the invoice and then process them in typically
        EAM machines - EAM means Electrical Accounting Machines - punched card
        machines - until they produced a printed invoice. So this was random
        access to the individual punched card records.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        Obviously, you could replace that tub file with some sort of a magnetic
        storage that would be automatic. Let's try it. What kind of a magnetic
        storage could we find? So Critchlow looked at many alternatives. There
        had been an article published in Electrical Engineering (in 1950) by
        Jacob Rabinow. It described a funny disk drive with a number of
        stationary disks in the shape of an 'O' with a 'V' cut into them so a
        head could move around and select a disk. After selection, the disk was
        then rotated - a really amazing mechanical monster. From that starting
        point, they said - why not rotate the disk constantly and cause the head
        to move back and forth between the disks? Critchlow proposed a project,
        which was ultimately labeled the file-to-card machine, which was really
        just a storage device to replace the tub file. Tom was a vital
        ingredient for making those pieces fit.

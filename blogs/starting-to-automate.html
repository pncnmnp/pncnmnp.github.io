<p>It was somewhere in 2017 that I decided to automate my daily activities. This was around the time I was learning <i>python</i> and <i>linux shell</i>.</p>
<p>I was introduced to automation while reading <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/#automate">automate the boring stuff with python</a>. The book along with my shell scripting experience helped automate quite a few things.</p>
<p>I started with customizing my <i>.bashrc</i> file. Today my <i>.bashrc</i> contains an <i>extracting tool</i>, <i>weather tool</i> and a handful of <i>aliases</i> I cannot live without. I have a huge collection of TV shows and picking one episode out of many was an ordeal back then, so I automated my collection using this <a href="https://gist.github.com/pncnmnp/62f9775103c4166f861777d5108f3c9b">script</a>. To this date this script, happens to be one of my most used shell command.</p>
<p>To find out your most used shell commands ( on Linux ) use:</p>
<noscript><br><b>To enable syntax highlighting, enable JS.</b></noscript>
<p><pre><code class="language-bash">awk '{print $1}' ~/.bash_history | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10</code></pre></p>
<p>Anyways, just the other day, I was thinking of automating my blog by making a <i>Markdown to HTML</i> parser and, <i>lo and behold</i>, today I have done just that. That's right! From now on, this blog's contents will be written in Markdown. I will soon release the parser on my github page!</p>
<p><i>That's it Folks!</i></p>
<p><i>Bye</i></p>

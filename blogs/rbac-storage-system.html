      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Access control</b>
        <a
          href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/access_control
        "
          >is defined</a
        >
        by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the
        process of permitting or restricting access to applications at a
        granular level, such as per-user, per-group, and per-resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we read this definition, one of the first words that come to mind
        is <i>passwords.</i> The history of passwords is diverse and certainly
        rich. In older times, they were commonly known as <i>watchwords</i>. In
        his 1906 book on the

        The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) was the first computer system
        to use password-based login. Professor Robert Fano, who was involved in
        CTSS development,
        <a
          href="https://www.multicians.org/fano1967.html
        "
          >spoke about the use of passwords at a 1967 IEEE conference</a
        >:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          There are a number of system features that deserve special mention.
          The private files of each individual are protected by a personal
          password, which is requested by the system at the beginning of each
          session at a terminal. The teletypewriter's printer is disabled while
          the password is given, so that no record of it can be seen by other
          people. The password is checked by the system against the user's name
          and problem number, and further access is denied if any mismatch is
          detected.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together with this mechanism for insuring privacy of individual files,
          the system includes facilities for making one's work easily available
          to other people. A "permit" command is available for authorizing the
          use of any particular file on the part of other people. Permission can
          be granted to any number of specifically named individuals, or to
          everybody, or even to everybody but Joe. The authorization can be
          limited to using and copying a file, or it can include the right to
          modify it or even delete it. Once a person has been authorized to use
          a file owned by somebody else, he can "link" to it by means of an
          appropriate command and thereafter use it as if it were his own. The
          links established by each user are recorded in his file directory,
          together with the records of his own files. These facilities for
          making one's work available to other people are extensively used. At
          present, the average number of recorded links per user of the Project
          MAC system is 27, and the average number of private files per user is
          34.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Additionally, Tom Van Vleck, a CTSS system programmer,
        <a
          href="https://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html
        "
          >shared a fascinating story</a
        >
        about the use of passwords in CTSS:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The one time XEC * was used in a good way was the day in 1966 that a
        certain Computation Center administrator's mistake caused the CTSS
        password file and the message of the day to be swapped. Everybody's
        password was displayed in clear to each user that logged in. (The editor
        in those days created a temporary file with a fixed name.) This was
        before (and was the origin of) the idea of one-way encrypting passwords.
        Bill Mathews of Project TIP noticed the passwords coming out, and
        quickly entered the debugger and crashed the machine by entering an XEC
        * instruction. Naturally this happened at 5 PM on a Friday, and I had to
        spend several unplanned hours changing people's passwords. (The problem
        is described and analyzed in Corby's Turing Award Lecture.)
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        For some context, <code>XEC *</code> would cause the CPU to “sit there
        taking I-cycles, uninterruptible, until an operator manually reset the
        CPU.”
      </p>

      <h2>Access Control Models: RBAC and ABAC</h2>
      <p>
        Access control mechanisms have significantly evolved since the 1960s.
        Today, <b>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</b> is one of the more common
        access control models. For instance, an MNC with a storage system for
        employee records can tie access privileges with job responsibilities to
        ensure only authorized employees have access to the records. In this
        scenario, an HR manager would have read and write access to all employee
        records, while a software manager would only have access to records of
        employees who report under her. Such roles are then assigned to
        individual users, with new employees receiving access privileges related
        to their roles.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this blog, we will primarily discuss RBAC models, specifically
        RBAC<sub>0</sub>, whose state can be formally described as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>U</code> is a set of users</li>
        <li><code>R</code> is a set of roles</li>
        <li><code>P</code> is a set of permissions</li>
        <li>
          <code>PA</code> is the permission assignment relation, a subset of
          <code>R x P</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>UR</code> is the user assignment relation, a subset of
          <code>U x R</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>auth</code> determines if a given user <code>u</code> with a
          role <code>r</code> can use permission <code>p</code>. This is true
          when <code>(u, r)</code> is in set <code>UR</code> and
          <code>(r, p)</code> is in set <code>PA</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This system will be useful in our discussion of construction. See Figure
        2 for a visual representation of RBAC.
      </p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There are other access control models out there, such as
        <b>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</b>. ABACs are known to provide
        more fine-tuning than their RBAC counterparts. To get a better idea,
        imagine that the aforementioned MNC has a department working on
        government projects. Such projects likely require a security clearance
        level (an example of an <b>attribute</b>). Two employees in the
        organization may have the same roles (e.g., SDE-2), but their security
        clearance levels differ. If we use ABAC with security clearance level as
        an attribute, a user attempting to access the file but not meeting these
        criteria will be denied access.
      </p>

      <h2>Identity-based encryption and Identity-based signature</h2>
      <p>
        Before we jump into the architecture, let's discuss some preliminaries,
        such as identity-based encryption (IBE) and Identity-based signature
        (IBS) schemes, which we will be using during the construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Identity-Based Encryption</b> is a type of public-key encryption
        system that provides confidentiality by encrypting messages. It allows
        the use of user identities, such as email addresses, phone numbers, IP
        addresses, or other unique identifiers, as public keys. This is
        different from traditional public-key encryption, where a user's public
        key is typically a large pseudo-random number. IBEs can be particularly
        useful in scenarios where key management is challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog post, we won't dive into the different types of IBE
        systems, but we will take a brief look at the four algorithms used by
        these systems. For our purposes, their implementation can be thought of
        as an abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The four algorithms are <code>MSKGen</code>, <code>KeyGen</code>,
        <code>Enc</code>, and <code>Dec</code>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>MSKGen</code> takes a security parameter <code>n</code> and
          generates public parameters <code>pp</code>, and master key
          <code>msk</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>KeyGen</code> takes the master key <code>msk</code> and the
          <code>ID</code> and generates a private key
          <code>k<sub>ID</sub></code> for the <code>ID</code>. Here,
          <code>ID</code> is the public key and can be something like a user's
          email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Enc</code> encrypts the message <code>m</code> using the public
          key <code>ID</code> and public parameters <code>pp</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Dec</code> decrypts the ciphertext using the private key
          <code>k<sub>ID</sub></code
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A visual representation of IBE is provided in Figure 3.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/rbac/ibe.png" style="height: 100%; width: 60%" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 3: A visual representation of IBE. Here, Admin acts as a
          private key generator (PKG).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Now, let's take a look at <b>Identity-Based Signature</b> schemes. IBE
        and IBS are related in the sense that they both use a user's identity
        (such as an email address) as a public key. However, the difference lies
        in their functionality. IBS schemes are used to sign messages to prove
        their authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, a user's identity is used to generate a signature that is
        attached to the message to prove that the message was created by the
        user and has not been altered since then. The receiver of the message
        can then verify its authenticity by using the user's identity and
        signature. The private keys are generated using a trusted third party,
        known as the <b>Private Key Generator (PKG)</b>. A visual representation
        of IBS is shown in Figure 4.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./pics/rbac/ibs.png" style="height: 100%; width: 80%" />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 4: A visual representation of IBS. Here, Admin acts as a
          private key generator (PKG). Furthermore, there is a level of
          indirection on the receiver's side as Alice sends the message to the
          Minimal Reference Monitor for authenticity verification. This is done
          to stay consistent with the construction part that we will be
          discussing next.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As before, we won't be delving into the implementation, but it is
        important to familiarize ourselves with the following algorithms:
        <code>MSKGen</code>, <code>KeyGen</code>, <code>Sign</code>, and
        <code>Ver</code>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>MSKGen</code> takes a security parameter <code>n</code> and
          generates public parameters <code>pp</code>, and master key
          <code>msk</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>KeyGen</code> takes the master key <code>msk</code> and the
          <code>ID</code> and generates a private signing key
          <code>s<sub>ID</sub></code> for this <code>ID</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Sign</code> takes the message <code>M</code> and the private key
          <code>s<sub>ID</sub></code> to generate a signature <code>sig</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Ver</code> takes the message <code>M</code> and signature
          <code>sig</code> to help verify whether <code>sig</code> is valid for
          a given <code>ID</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Enforcing RBAC<sub>0</sub> in a cloud storage system</h2>
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        In this blog post, we will consider a cloud storage system with three
        entities: an <b>administrator</b>, a <b>user</b>, and a
        <b>cloud storage service</b>. Figure 5 provides a visualization of this
        system.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./pics/rbac/architecture.png"
          style="height: 100%; width: 60%"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Figure 5: A visual representation of the cloud storage system. This
          figure is from the paper.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The <i>administrator</i> is mainly responsible for managing
        cryptographic keys, such as creating and revoking them. For example, as
        we saw in the IBE and IBS sections, the administrator would act as a
        trusted third party and be responsible for using their master key
        <code>msk</code> to generate a private signing key for a user.
        Interestingly, in this architecture, any user can download files from
        the cloud. However, since all files are encrypted, only the user with
        the appropriate role-based key can decrypt, read, and modify their
        contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        As can be seen, the files are hosted in the cloud, along with the access
        control policy data that protects them. The read access permissions are
        enforced on the user's side, whereas the write permissions are enforced
        on the cloud side. Before authorizing writes, a
        <b> minimal reference monitor </b> validates the user's signature. The
        architecture we will be examining makes the following assumptions about
        the storage system:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the cloud provider is not trusted to view the contents of the stored
          files,
        </li>
        <li>trusted with ensuring the availability of the files, and</li>
        <li>
          trusted to ensure that only authorized users can update their
          respective files.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With all these preliminaries in mind, let's move on to a naive
        construction for enforcing RBAC<sub>0</sub> on a cloud storage system.
      </p>
      <h3>Naive Construction</h3>
      <p>
        When a new user, such as Alice, joins an organization, she must complete
        an initial registration process with the administrator. The
        administrator will use their master keys (<code>msk</code>) to generate
        two private keys: <code>k<sub>u</sub></code> and
        <code>s<sub>u</sub></code
        >, using <code>KeyGen</code> for the IBE and IBS schemes, respectively.
        These private keys will be sent to Alice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when a new role, such as Sales Ninja, is created in the
        organization, the administrator will generate similar private keys:
        <code>k<sub>r</sub></code> and <code>s<sub>r</sub></code
        >, using <code>KeyGen</code>. For each user, such as Alice, assigned to
        this role, the administrator creates and uploads a tuple of the form
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <blockquote>
<code>&lt;RK, Alice’s ID, role, Enc(kr, sr), IBS signature of the administrator&gt;
</code>
</blockquote>
      <p>
        Here, <code>RK</code> is a special value indicating that this is a role
        key tuple. <code>Enc(k<sub>r</sub>, s<sub>r</sub>)</code> provides Alice
        with cryptographically protected access to
        <code>k<sub>r</sub></code> and <code>s<sub>r</sub></code
        >. The administrator does this by using Alice's private key (<code
          >k<sub>u</sub></code
        >) to encrypt the message (<code>k<sub>r</sub></code> and
        <code>s<sub>r</sub></code
        >) with Alice's identity. As Alice also has her private key, she can
        easily decrypt and obtain <code>k<sub>r</sub></code
        >/<code>s<sub>r</sub></code
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each file that is to be shared with a particular role, the
        administrator creates and uploads a tuple of the form
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <blockquote>
<code>&lt;F, role, &lt;file name, access privileges&gt;, Enc(file), IBS signature of the administrator&gt;</code></blockquote>

      <p>
        Again, <code>F</code> is a special value indicating that this is a file
        tuple, and <code>Enc(file)</code> is an IBE-encrypted file with a role
        as the <code>ID</code>. The access privileges can be read or read-write
        and the file can be decrypted using the private key
        <code>k<sub>r</sub></code> corresponding to that role.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the administrator completes the preparation, a user can start
        reading and writing their authorized files. Let's say, Alice, who is a
        Sales Ninja, wants to read an authorized file called
        <code>sales.txt</code>. To do this, she needs to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download an <code>RK</code> tuple for the Sales Ninja role and an
          <code>F</code> tuple for <code>sales.txt</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Validate the IBS signatures on both tuples.</li>
        <li>
          Decrypt <code>k<sub>r</sub></code> from the <code>RK</code> tuple
          using her private IBE key <code>k<sub>u</sub></code
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decrypt <code>sales.txt</code> using <code>k<sub>r</sub></code> and
          read the file.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To write to a file, Alice can create a new <code>F</code> tuple:</p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <blockquote>
        <code>&lt;F, Sales Ninja, &lt;sales.txt, write&gt;, Enc(updated sales.txt), IBS signature of Alice&gt;</code></blockquote>
      <p>
        once she's done changing the contents locally. She can then send it to
        the cloud. If the minimal reference monitor can verify Alice's
        signature, the file <code>sales.txt</code> will be replaced with the
        updated one.
      </p>
      <h3>Issues with the Construction and Suggested Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        The above construction has significant issues. For instance, encrypting
        large amounts of data using IBE can impact performance, and the
        <code>F</code> tuple incurs duplicate work as the entire file needs to
        be encrypted multiple times, once for each role.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these issues, it's recommended to split an
        <code>F</code> tuple into two tuples, <code>F</code> and
        <code>FK</code>, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>FK</code> tuple is:
          <!-- prettier-ignore --><code>&lt;FK, role, &lt;file name, access privileges&gt;, Enc(k), IBS signature of the administrator&gt;</code
          >. Here, <code>k</code> is a symmetric key generated by the
          administrator, and <code>Enc(k)</code> encrypts this key using the IBE
          scheme with the role as <code>ID</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>F</code> tuple is:
          <!-- prettier-ignore --><code>&lt;F, file name, Enc(file), IBS signature using the role key of the last authorized updater&gt;</code
          >. Here, <code>Enc(file)</code> uses faster
          <b> symmetric-key cryptography </b> with <code>k</code> as the
          symmetric key, rather than the IBE scheme.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This technique greatly reduces duplication, as a single
        <code>F</code> tuple can be created for a file, with multiple
        <code>FK</code> tuples, one for each role. Only one symmetric key per
        file needs to be generated, and a more cost-efficient symmetric key
        cryptography is used for encrypting files.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another issue with the construction is the lack of provision for
        <b>revoking</b> access to a file. Ideally, we should be able to do this
        on a <i>per-role</i> and <i>per-user level</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        One way to address this issue is by <b>versioning</b> the tuples. To
        achieve per-role functionality, we create a version number
        <code>v</code> corresponding to the symmetric key <code>k</code> and use
        it to version the <code>F</code> and <code>FK</code> tuples. To remove
        permission for a role, we create a new version number, use it to
        generate a new symmetric key, and re-encrypt the file with it. This
        would not only modify the <code>F</code> tuple but also the
        <code>FK</code> tuples for all the roles whose access to the file has
        not been revoked.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        That's all for now! The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the
        efficiency of this construction, and it also includes algorithms for
        various operations, such as adding and deleting users, as well as
        revoking access and permissions. If you're interested in learning more,
        I highly recommend checking out the paper for further details.

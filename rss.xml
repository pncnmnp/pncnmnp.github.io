            <title>Scrambling Eggs for Spotify with Knuth's Fibonacci Hashing</title>
            <link>https://pncnmnp.github.io/blogs/fibonacci-hashing.html</link>
            <description>In this blog post, we explore Spotify's journey from using the Fisher-Yates shuffle to a more sophisticated song shuffling algorithm that prevents clustering of tracks by the same artist. We then connect this challenge to Fibonacci hashing, and propose a novel, evenly distributed artist shuffling method.</description>
